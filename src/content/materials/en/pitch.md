# Description of what it is like

Pitch is a black or dark brown solid substance produced by distilling tar. It is hard and brittle at room temperature (can be shattered with a hammer) but flows very slowly over time (viscoelastic) and melts into a liquid when heated.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Production**: Derived from **[Tar](/en/materials/tar)** (wood tar or coal tar) or **[Crude Oil](/en/materials/crude-oil)** (bitumen/asphalt).
- **Natural Sources**: Some natural asphalt lakes (like Pitch Lake in Trinidad) exist, but historically it's made from pine tar.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Distillation**: Take **[Tar](/en/materials/tar)** and boil it in an open pot.
2.  **Evaporation**: Let the water and volatile oils boil off.
3.  **Testing**: Dip a stick in and cool it. If the drop hardens and snaps when bent, it's pitch. If it's still sticky/soft, it's still tar.
4.  **Cooling**: Pour into molds or blocks for storage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pot**: Metal or ceramic pot for boiling (will be permanently stained).
- **Heat Source**: Fire.
- **Stirring Stick**: To prevent burning at the bottom.

### Common forms of use

- **Caulking**: Mixed with fibers (oakum) to seal seams in wooden ships.
- **Cutler's Resin**: Mixed with beeswax and dust/filler to glue knife handles.
- **Chasing Pitch**: Used by metalworkers to hold metal pieces while hammering/repoussé.
- **Torches**: Coated on sticks for long-burning lights.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)**: For sealing (less durable).
- **[Pine Resin Glue](/en/materials/pine-resin-glue)**: Similar adhesive properties.
- **[Asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt)**: The petroleum equivalent.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness**: If boiled too long or used in freezing cold, it cracks easily.
- **Flow**: In very hot weather, it may soften and run (sag).
- **Burns**: Molten pitch sticks to skin and causes severe burns ("napalm" effect).

### Risks and safety

- **Fumes**: Boiling tar produces flammable and unhealthy fumes. Work outdoors.
- **Fire**: Highly flammable.
