Enzymes are biological catalysts, usually proteins, that accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed. They enable processes like milk coagulation, fermentation, and controlled breakdown of foods.

## Description of what it is like

Enzymes are invisible in pure form; they are typically used as liquids, pastes, or powders. Activity depends on temperature and acidity, and many enzymes stop working when overheated.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Present in living organisms, especially digestive systems, plants, and microbes.
- **Signs**: Rennet extracts, plant sap coagulants, or starter cultures that rapidly change food texture.
- **It is a natural material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Extraction**: Soak or macerate enzyme-rich tissue or cultures in clean water or brine.
- **Filtration**: Remove solids using **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or fine strainers.
- **Stabilization**: Salt, drying, or cool storage to preserve activity.
- **If skipped**: Activity drops quickly and contamination spoils the batch.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Containers**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for soaking and storage.
- **Filtering**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or sieves to clarify extracts.
- **Temperature control**: Cool storage to slow degradation.

### Common forms of use

- Liquid rennet for rapid milk coagulation.
- Dried enzyme powder for transport.
- Plant-based coagulants for fresh curds.
- Enzyme-rich starters for repeated batches.

### Possible substitutes

- **Acids**: **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** or citrus to curdle milk, with different texture.
- **Heat**: Gentle heating to thicken proteins, less effective than enzymes.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Denaturation**: Excess heat or extreme pH destroys activity.
- **Weak batches**: Old or diluted extracts coagulate slowly.
- **Contamination**: Dirty tools introduce unwanted microbes.

### Risks and safety

- **Allergies**: Protein enzymes can trigger reactions.
- **Food safety**: Poor hygiene can contaminate dairy products.
- **Dosage errors**: Too much enzyme leads to bitter or rubbery curd.
