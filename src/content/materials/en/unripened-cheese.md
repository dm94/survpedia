Unripened cheese is fresh curd drained and lightly salted without aging. It preserves milk for short periods while keeping a soft texture and mild flavor.

## Description of what it is like

Soft, moist, and creamy, sometimes crumbly depending on how much whey is drained. Flavor is mild and slightly tangy, with high moisture content.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever **[Livestock](/en/knowledge/livestock)** provide milk and clean containers are available.
- **Signs**: Fresh milk, light acid or rennet sources, and clean cloth for draining.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Coagulation**: Warm milk and add acid or **[Enzymes](/en/materials/enzymes)** to form curds.
- **Draining**: Pour through **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** to remove whey.
- **Light salting**: Mix a small amount of **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** to stabilize briefly.
- **If skipped**: High moisture and low salt lead to fast spoilage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Heat**: Gentle **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to warm milk.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining.

### Common forms of use

- Fresh curd eaten immediately.
- Soft cheeses for spreads or fillings.
- Crumbled cheese for salads and soups.

### Possible substitutes

- Thickened milk or yogurt when available.
- Dried legumes or nuts for protein when no milk exists.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Spoilage**: Short shelf life without cooling.
- **Wateriness**: Poor draining makes it runny and bland.
- **Sourness**: Excess acid produces harsh flavor and brittle curd.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk and poor sanitation can carry pathogens.
- **Allergies**: Dairy proteins can trigger reactions.
