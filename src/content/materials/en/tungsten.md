# Brief description

Tungsten (or Wolfram) is a rare metal known for having the highest melting point of all elements. It is essential for high-temperature applications.

## Properties

-   **Heat Resistance:** Withstands extremely high temperatures without melting (3422 °C).
-   **Density:** Very heavy, comparable to gold.
-   **Hardness:** Very hard and durable, especially when alloyed.

## Usage

-   **Filaments:** Used in incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes due to its ability to glow white-hot without melting.
-   **Electrodes:** Used in TIG welding.
-   **Alloys:** Hardens steel for tools and armor.

## Manufacturing/Extraction

Extracted from ores like wolframite and scheelite. Requires complex chemical processing and reduction with hydrogen or carbon at high temperatures to produce pure metal powder, which is then sintered.
