Tungsten (or wolfram) is a dense, refractory metal prized for surviving extreme heat and wear. It is essential in X-ray tubes, filaments, and hard alloys.

## Description of what it is like

Tungsten is silvery-gray, very heavy in the hand, and hard but brittle at room temperature. It keeps its strength at temperatures that soften most metals.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Found in hydrothermal veins and granitic regions.
- Signs: Ores such as wolframite (dark, heavy) and scheelite (pale, dense).
- It is a natural element but requires advanced processing to isolate.

### Minimum processing required

- Crushing and concentrating the ore.
- Roasting to convert minerals into tungstates.
- Chemical conversion to tungsten oxide.
- High-temperature reduction with hydrogen or carbon.
- Sintering or hot pressing to form solid parts.

### Tools needed to work on it

- High-temperature furnaces and refractory crucibles.
- Reducing atmosphere control (hydrogen or carbon sources).
- Presses and grinders for powder metallurgy.
- Carbide tooling for machining.

### Common forms of use

- Sintered rods and plates.
- Wire or filaments.
- Carbide tips in cutting tools.
- Dense shields or counterweights.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Steel](/en/materials/steel):** Lower heat resistance but easier to work.
- **[Copper](/en/materials/copper):** Better thermal conduction but melts much earlier.
- **[Lead](/en/materials/lead):** High density for shielding but soft and toxic.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittle if not alloyed or processed correctly.
- Difficult to melt or cast; most work requires powder metallurgy.
- Oxidizes at very high temperatures in air.

### Risks and safety

- Fine dust is a respiratory hazard.
- High-temperature processing risks severe burns and fire.

- **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**: Used for electrical and thermal connections.
- **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**: Often used alongside tungsten for shielding.
