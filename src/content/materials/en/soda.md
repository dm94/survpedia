Soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) is a white, odorless, water-soluble salt. It is a critical industrial chemical, historically obtained from the ashes of sodium-rich plants.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** White powder or crystalline solid.
- **Taste:** Strongly alkaline (cooling taste).
- **Solubility:** Dissolves easily in water.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Saline lakes (natron deposits) or ashes of seashore plants (barilla, kelp).
- **Signs:** White crusts on dry lake beds.
- **Natural:** Occurs as the mineral natron.

### Minimum processing required

- **Leaching:** Soaking plant ashes in water to dissolve the salts.
- **Evaporation:** Boiling the water to crystallize the soda.
- **Calcination:** Heating to remove water and bicarbonates.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pots/Kettles:** For boiling and leaching.
- **Furnace:** For burning plants or calcining.

### Common forms of use

- **Flux:** Lowers the melting point of silica for glass.
- **Lye:** Reacted with lime to make caustic soda for soap.
- **Cleaner:** Washing soda for laundry.

### Possible substitutes

- **Potash:** Potassium carbonate from wood ashes (makes glass harder/less durable).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Humidity:** Absorbs moisture from air and clumps.

### Risks and safety

- **Irritant:** Dust irritates eyes and lungs. Solution is alkaline and can irritate skin.
