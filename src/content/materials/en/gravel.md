# Brief description

Gravel is a loose aggregation of rock fragments. It is classified by particle size range and includes size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments.

## Description of what it is like

Small, hard stones. They can be rounded (river gravel) or angular (crushed stone). The color and texture depend on the parent rock.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Riverbeds, streams, and geological deposits where water has flowed.
- **Signs:** Accumulations of small stones.
- **Natural:** Yes, widely available.

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection:** Shoveling.
- **Washing:** To remove dirt and silt.
- **Sorting/Sifting:** Separating by size using screens.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Shovel:** For moving it.
- **Sieve/Screen:** For sorting sizes.
- **Rake:** For spreading.

### Common forms of use

- **Drainage:** Provides a porous layer for water to flow through (e.g., French drains).
- **Roads:** Base layer for roads or surface for driveways.
- **Concrete:** Mixed with cement and sand to add bulk and strength.
- **Filtration:** Used in water filters to trap particles.

### Possible substitutes

- **Crushed Stone:** Artificially produced gravel.
- **Sand:** For finer applications (though less permeable).
- **Recycled Concrete:** Crushed concrete can act as gravel.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Instability:** Rolls and shifts if not contained.
- **Weeds:** Plants can grow through it easily.
- **Migration:** Can be washed away by heavy water flow if not secured.

### Risks and safety

- **Heavy:** Moving large amounts is strenuous.
- **Projectiles:** Can be thrown by tires or machinery.

### Related materials

- **Sand:** Smaller particles.
- **Stone:** Larger parent material.
- **Concrete:** Composite material using gravel.
