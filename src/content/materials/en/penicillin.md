Penicillin is a family of beta-lactam antibiotics produced by _Penicillium_ molds. It was the first widely used antibiotic and remains a model for understanding antibacterial drugs.

## Description of what it is like

Usually a white to off-white powder or crystalline solid with a faint odor. It degrades with heat, strong acids, and long exposure to moisture.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Penicillium molds occur in soil, decaying plant matter, and on spoiled food.
- **Signs**: Blue-green mold growth on bread or fruit.
- **It is a processed material extracted from a natural organism.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Cultivation**: Grow Penicillium in a nutrient broth under clean conditions.
- **Fermentation**: Allow the mold to produce penicillin under controlled temperature and oxygen.
- **Extraction**: Filter out the mold and separate penicillin using pH shifts and solvents.
- **Purification and drying**: Concentrate and dry to a stable form.

If poorly processed, potency is low or contaminated, and the product may be unsafe.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Clean containers**: Glass or stainless for sterile culture and storage.
- **Filtration**: Cloth or paper filters to remove biomass.
- **Temperature control**: Cool, stable environment for fermentation.
- **pH control**: Simple acids/bases to manage extraction steps.

### Common forms of use

- **Crude broth**: Low-purity liquid used historically before purification.
- **Purified powder**: Stable, transportable form for dosing.
- **Salts**: Sodium or potassium salts for improved solubility.

### Possible substitutes

- Other antibiotics (if available) with different spectra.
- Antiseptics for external use when antibiotics are not available.
- Honey and herbal preparations for minor wounds (less reliable).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Spectrum**: Ineffective against viruses and many resistant bacteria.
- **Resistance**: Misuse promotes resistant strains.
- **Instability**: Degrades in heat, strong acids, and over time.
- **Allergy**: Some people are hypersensitive to beta-lactams.

### Risks and safety

- **Allergic reactions**: Rashes to anaphylaxis are possible.
- **Contamination**: Unsterile production can introduce harmful microbes.
- **Dosing errors**: Underdosing fosters resistance; overdosing increases side effects.
