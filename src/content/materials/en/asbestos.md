Asbestos is a group of six naturally occurring silicate minerals made of microscopic fibers. It was once hailed as a "miracle mineral" for its heat resistance and durability but is now known to be highly toxic.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as fibrous rock or soft, fluffy fibers (white, blue, or brown). It can be woven into cloth or mixed with cement.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Mineral**: Found in metamorphic rocks.
- **Mines**: Large deposits in Russia, China, Canada (historical), and Brazil.

### Minimum processing required

- **Mining**: Extraction of ore.
- **Crushing/Milling**: To release the fibers from the rock.
- **Grading**: Sorting fibers by length.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mining tools**: Drills, crushers.
- **Safety Gear**: **CRITICAL**. Full hazmat suits and respirators are required to handle it safely today.

### Common forms of use

- **Insulation**: Wrapped around steam pipes or in attics (vermiculite often contained asbestos).
- **Construction**: Asbestos-cement sheets (corrugated roofing), floor tiles.
- **Fireproofing**: Sprayed onto steel beams.
- **Friction**: Brake linings and clutch facings.

### Possible substitutes

- **Fiberglass**: For insulation.
- **Mineral Wool**: For fireproofing and insulation.
- **Cellulose fibers**: For cement reinforcement.
- **Kevlar/Ceramics**: For brakes and high-heat applications.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Friability**: As it ages, it becomes friable (crumbles easily), releasing fibers into the air.
- **Health Hazard**: The major failure is its impact on human health, not its mechanical performance.

### Risks and safety

- **Cancer**: Mesothelioma and lung cancer. No safe level of exposure.
- **Asbestosis**: Scarring of the lungs.
- **Avoidance**: If found in old buildings, **DO NOT DISTURB IT**. Encapsulation is safer than removal by amateurs.
