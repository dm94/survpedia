Cork is a natural material obtained from the bark of the cork oak (_Quercus suber_). It consists of suberin, a hydrophobic substance, and is composed of millions of microscopic air-filled cells, making it lightweight and compressible.

## Description of what it is like

It is a spongy, light, and elastic material with a woody texture but soft to the touch. It floats in water and does not absorb moisture easily.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Mediterranean forests (Portugal, Spain, North Africa).
- **Signs**: Trees with thick, rugged, spongy bark.
- **Harvest**: The bark is stripped from the living tree without harming it.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Carefully stripping the bark in summer.
- **Boiling**: To clean it, remove insects, and increase flexibility and volume.
- **Drying**: To stabilize moisture content.
- **Cutting**: Into desired shapes (stoppers, boards).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Axe/Hatchet**: Specialized axes for stripping bark without damaging the cambium.
- **Knife**: For shaping stoppers or floats.
- **Boiling vat**: For processing raw bark.

### Common forms of use

- **Stoppers**: Sealing wine or oil bottles due to elasticity and impermeability.
- **Boards**: Compressed granules for wall or floor insulation.
- **Floats**: For fishing nets or life preservers.

### Possible substitutes

- **Rubber/Silicone**: For stoppers and gaskets (modern).
- **Polystyrene**: For insulation and buoyancy (modern).
- **Corn cobs**: Primitive stoppers (less effective).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness**: Can crumble if very old or dry.
- **Taint**: "Cork taint" (TCA) can spoil wine if the cork is infected with fungus.
- **Scarcity**: Trees take decades to mature and years between harvests.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Although fire-resistant compared to wood, it will eventually burn.
- **Dust**: Cork dust can be flammable or irritating.
