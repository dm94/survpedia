# Brief description

Quartz (often called Rock Crystal when clear) is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). It is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust. Its clarity and hardness make it a superior natural substitute for glass in optics.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Ideally colorless and transparent (Rock Crystal), but can be white (Milky), purple (Amethyst), yellow (Citrine), or dark (Smoky) depending on impurities.
- **Texture:** Smooth, glassy, and cold to the touch.
- **Hardness:** Very hard (Mohs 7). It scratches glass and steel.
- **Crystal Shape:** Often forms hexagonal prisms with pyramid-like ends.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Occurrence:** Found globally in all types of rocks (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary).
- **Location:** Look in riverbeds for rounded pebbles, or in geodes and veins in mountains for distinct crystals.
- **Recognition:** Its hexagonal shape and hardness (cannot be scratched by a knife) are key identifiers.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Extraction:** Mining from veins or collecting loose crystals.
2.  **Cleaning:** Washing off clay and dirt.
3.  **Cutting/Knapping:** Can be chipped like flint (conchoidal fracture) or cut with diamond saws.
4.  **Polishing:** Needs harder abrasives than glass (like diamond dust or corundum) to polish effectively.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hammer and Chisel:** For extraction.
- **Lapidary Wheel:** For cutting and polishing (needs sand/water or harder grits).
- **Leather/Felt:** For final polishing.

### Common forms of use

- **Optics:** Carved into superior lenses that transmit UV light (unlike glass).
- **Oscillators:** Thin slices of quartz generate electricity when stressed (piezoelectricity), essential for **[Radios](/en/inventions/radio)** and quartz clocks.
- **Abrasive:** Crushed quartz is the main component of sandpaper and sandblasting.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass):** Easier to melt and shape, but softer and blocks UV light.
- **Transparent Calcite (Iceland Spar):** Clear but soft and has double refraction (doubles the image).
- **Diamond:** Much harder and better optically, but rare and impossible to work with primitive tools.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittle:** Like glass, it can shatter if struck.
- **Hardness:** Very difficult to carve without harder abrasives.
- **Heat Shock:** Can crack with sudden temperature changes, though less than glass.

### Risks and safety

- **Silicosis:** Breathing in fine quartz dust from grinding is dangerous to the lungs. Always wet-grind or wear a mask.
- **Sharp Edges:** Fractured quartz has razor-sharp edges.

### Related materials

- **[Sand](/en/materials/sand):** Often composed mostly of weathered quartz.
- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass):** Synthetic silica.
- **[Flint](/en/materials/flint):** A microcrystalline variety of quartz.
