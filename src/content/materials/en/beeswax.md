Beeswax is a natural wax produced by honey bees of the genus Apis. It is an incredibly versatile material used for lighting, waterproofing, and as a structural component in mixtures.

## Description of what it is like

A tough wax that is brittle when cold but becomes plastic and malleable when warmed by hand. It ranges in color from white (new) to yellow or brown (older/pollen-stained). It has a sweet, honey-like scent.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Wherever bee colonies exist (hollow trees, rock crevices, beehives).
- **Origin**: Secreted by worker bees to build honeycombs.
- **Natural**: Requires harvesting from the hive.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Removing the comb from the hive (often after honey extraction).
- **Melting**: Heating the comb in water to separate wax from debris.
- **Filtering**: Straining the molten wax through cloth.
- **Cooling**: Allowing it to harden into blocks.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pot**: For melting (double boiler is best to prevent burning).
- **Cloth**: For filtering.
- **Molds**: To shape the cooling wax.

### Common forms of use

- **[Candles](/en/inventions/candle)**: Burns slowly and cleanly without smoke.
- **Ointments/Salves**: Mixed with **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** or **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** to thicken medicinal mixtures.
- **Waterproofing**: Rubbed onto leather or fabric and melted in.
- **Wood Polish**: Mixed with turpentine or oil to protect wood.

### Possible substitutes

- **Paraffin**: Modern petroleum-based wax.
- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Can be used for waterproofing or candles (tallow), but smells and is softer.
- **Pine Resin**: For sealing and adhesive purposes.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Melting Point**: Melts at ~62°C (144°F). Can deform in very hot environments.
- **Brittleness**: Can crack in freezing temperatures if not mixed with oil.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Flammable when molten.
- **Stings**: Harvesting requires dealing with bees.

### Related materials

- **Honey**: Found with the wax.
- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**: Often mixed with wax.
- **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**: Often mixed with wax for adhesives.
