Beeswax is a natural wax produced by honey bees of the genus Apis. The wax is formed into scales by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of worker bees, which discard it in or at the hive.

## Description of what it is like

It is a tough wax formed from a mixture of several chemical compounds. It is solid at room temperature, brittle when cold, and becomes soft and pliable when held in the hand. It has a pleasant, honey-like aroma.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Wherever honey bees are found (wild or domesticated).
- **Signs**: Beehives, honeycombs.
- **It is a natural material**: Produced directly by bees.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Collecting honeycombs (after removing honey).
- **Melting**: Heating in water to separate wax from debris.
- **Straining**: Filtering through cloth to remove impurities.
- **Cooling**: Allowing it to solidify into cakes.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pot**: For melting (double boiler recommended).
- **Strainer/Cloth**: For filtering.
- **Molds**: For shaping.

### Common forms of use

- **Solid Block**: For rubbing onto threads or tools.
- **Melted**: For dipping candles or mixing into salves.
- **Paste**: Mixed with oil or turpentine for polish.

### Possible substitutes

- **Paraffin Wax**: Petroleum-derived, cheaper but not renewable.
- **Soy Wax**: Plant-based, softer.
- **Animal Fat (Tallow)**: Can be used for candles but smells and is softer.
- **Pine Resin**: For waterproofing, but is sticky and brittle.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Melting Point**: Melts at relatively low temperatures (~62°C / 144°F).
- **Brittleness**: Can crack in freezing temperatures.
- **Flammability**: Can ignite if overheated directly.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns**: Melted wax can cause burns.
- **Fire**: Highly flammable when molten; never leave unattended on heat.
