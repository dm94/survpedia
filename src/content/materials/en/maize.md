Maize is a high-yield grain that can be eaten fresh or dried for long storage. It is widely used for porridge, breads, and animal feed.

## Description of what it is like

Large kernels attached to a central cob. Kernels harden when dried and can be ground into coarse meal or fine flour.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Warm, sunny fields with moderate rainfall.
- Signs: Tall stalks with broad leaves and ears wrapped in husks.
- It is a cultivated crop grown in rows or intercropped.

### Minimum processing required

- Drying: Ears are dried to reduce moisture.
- Shelling: Kernels are removed from the cob.
- Grinding: Kernels are milled into meal.
- Optional alkaline cooking: Improves nutrition and digestibility with **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)**.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Simple shelling by hand or with tools.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** for pounding.
- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for meal and flour.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for cooking.

### Common forms of use

- Boiled or roasted ears.
- Ground meal for porridge or flatbreads.
- Fermented doughs and drinks.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** or **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)** as alternative grains.
- **[Potato](/en/materials/potato)** or **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** as starchy roots.

### Limitations and common failures

- Nutrient gaps: Without alkaline cooking, niacin availability is low.
- Storage pests: Insects and rodents damage stored kernels.
- Moisture loss: Damp grain spoils quickly.

### Risks and safety

- Mold: Poorly dried grain can develop toxins.
- Fire risk: Milling dust is flammable in enclosed spaces.

### Related materials

- **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)**: Used in alkaline cooking for maize.
- **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**: Stalks can be used as bedding and mulch.
