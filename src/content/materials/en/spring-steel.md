# Description

A type of high-carbon or alloy steel with a very high yield strength. It allows objects made of spring steel to return to their original shape despite significant deflection or twisting.

## Description of what it is like

It looks like regular steel but is much harder to bend permanently. If bent within its elastic limit, it snaps back instantly.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Manufactured:** Does not occur naturally. Must be forged from iron and carbon with specific heat treatment.
- **Scavenging:** Old car suspension springs, saw blades, piano wire.

### Minimum processing required

- **Hardening:** Heating to critical temperature and quenching.
- **Tempering:** Reheating to a lower temperature to reduce brittleness and increase toughness.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Forge:** To heat treat.
- **Grinder:** To shape (hard to file).
- **Oil/Water:** For quenching.

### Common forms of use

- **Coiled Springs:** For suspension or mechanisms.
- **Flat Springs:** For leaf springs or clockwork mainsprings.

### Possible substitutes

- **Work-hardened Bronze:** For non-magnetic springs.
- **Wood/Bamboo:** For primitive bows or traps (lower durability).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Fatigue:** Repeated cycling can cause cracks and failure.
- **Rust:** High carbon content makes it prone to corrosion if not oiled or painted.
- **Overheating:** Losing temper if heated too much during grinding.

### Risks and safety

- **Snapping:** Can break violently under tension, releasing stored energy.
- **Shards:** Hard fragments can fly if it shatters.
