Polyurethane (PUR or PU) is a versatile polymer composed of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. In construction, it is most commonly encountered as rigid foam insulation boards (PIR) or spray foam.

## Description of what it is like

- **Rigid Foam**: Yellowish, lightweight, and very stiff. Often faced with foil or paper.
- **Spray Foam**: Expands rapidly upon application, filling cavities and adhering strongly to surfaces.
- **Elastomers**: Rubber-like materials used for wheels, seals, and shoe soles.
- **Coatings**: Clear, hard varnishes for wood floors.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic**: Product of the chemical industry.
- **Raw Materials**: Isocyanates and Polyols (derived from crude oil).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Chemical Synthesis**: Precise mixing of two liquid components (Isocyanate + Polyol).
2.  **Expansion**: The reaction generates heat and gas (blowing agent), causing the mixture to foam and expand 30-60 times.
3.  **Curing**: The foam hardens within minutes but reaches full strength over hours.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Spray Gun**: For application of spray foam (requires specialized equipment and training).
- **Saw/Knife**: To cut rigid boards.
- **Respirator**: Essential during application due to toxic fumes.

### Common forms of use

- **Rigid Boards (PIR/PUR)**: High-performance insulation for roofs, walls, and floors. Better R-value per inch than **[Polystyrene](/en/materials/polystyrene)** or **[Mineral Wool](/en/materials/mineral-wool)**.
- **Spray Foam**: Filling gaps, insulating uneven surfaces, and air-sealing.
- **Adhesives**: Very strong construction glues (e.g., Gorilla Glue).
- **Sealants**: Flexible joint fillers.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Polystyrene](/en/materials/polystyrene)**: Cheaper but less efficient insulator.
- **[Mineral Wool](/en/materials/mineral-wool)**: Fireproof and sound-absorbent, but lower R-value.
- **Cellulose**: Eco-friendly loose-fill alternative.
- **Rubber**: Natural alternative for elastomers.

### Limitations and common failures

- **UV Sensitivity**: Degrades rapidly in sunlight (turns yellow and powdery). Must be coated or covered.
- **Moisture**: Closed-cell foam is water-resistant, but open-cell foam can absorb water like a sponge.
- **Temperature**: Loses effectiveness at extremely high temperatures.

### Risks and safety

- **Isocyanates**: The raw components are sensitizers and can cause severe asthma and skin reactions. **Proper PPE is critical during application.**
- **Fire**: Highly flammable unless treated with fire retardants. Produces toxic smoke (cyanide, CO) when burned.
- **Off-gassing**: Poorly mixed foam can release odors and chemicals for a long time.
