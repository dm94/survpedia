A tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, baked clay, or even glass, generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.

## Description of what it is like

Tiles are typically thin, square or rectangular shapes. **Roof tiles** are often curved (like the Spanish or Roman style) to interlock and channel water. **Floor and wall tiles** are usually flat, glazed or unglazed, and can be highly decorative. They are hard, cold to the touch, and brittle.

## Origin and where to find it

Tiles are manufactured products.

- **Ceramic Tiles:** Made from **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)**, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, and other minerals, then fired in a **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)**.
- **Concrete Tiles:** Made from a mixture of **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, and **[Water](/en/materials/water)**.
- **Stone Tiles:** Cut from natural **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** (like slate, marble, granite).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Preparation:** Mix the raw materials (clay/water or cement/sand/water) to a plastic consistency.
2.  **Molding:** Shape the mixture into tiles using molds or extrusion. For roof tiles, specific curves are formed.
3.  **Drying:** Allow to dry to remove moisture.
4.  **Firing/Curing:**
    - **Clay:** Fire in a **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)** at high temperatures (vitrification).
    - **Concrete:** Allow to cure and harden over time.
5.  **Glazing (Optional):** Apply a glass-like coating for waterproofing and decoration before a second firing.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Molds:** Wooden or metal frames to shape the tiles.
- **Kiln:** Essential for ceramic tiles.
- **Trowel:** To apply **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** for fixing tiles.
- **Tile Cutter:** To cut tiles to fit specific spaces.

### Common forms of use

- **Roofing:** Overlapping tiles to shed water. Common shapes include flat, pantile, Roman, and barrel (monk and nun).
- **Flooring:** Durable and easy-to-clean surface for interiors and exteriors.
- **Walls:** Protective and decorative covering for kitchens, bathrooms, and facades.
- **Drainage:** Porous tiles used for drainage pipes.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood) Shingles:** Lighter but less fire-resistant.
- **[Slate](/en/materials/slate):** Very durable natural alternative for roofing.
- **[Metal](/en/materials/metal) Sheets:** Lightweight and durable roofing.
- **[Thatching](/en/inventions/thatching):** Plant stalks used for roofing (insulating but flammable).
- **[Brick](/en/materials/brick):** Can be used for flooring but is thicker.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness:** Tiles break easily under impact.
- **Weight:** Roof tiles are heavy and require a strong roof structure.
- **Frost Damage:** Porous tiles can absorb water and crack in freezing conditions (spalling).
- **Slippery:** Glazed tiles can be very slippery when wet.

### Risks and safety

- **Falling Objects:** Loose roof tiles can be dangerous.
- **Cuts:** Broken tiles have sharp edges.
- **Silica Dust:** Cutting tiles generates harmful dust.
