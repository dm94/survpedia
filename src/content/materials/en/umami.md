Umami is the deep, savory taste that adds fullness to broths, stews, and sauces. It comes from glutamates and nucleotides in certain foods and is intensified through processes like drying and fermentation.

## Description of what it is like

It is perceived as a lasting savory depth rather than a single aroma. In concentrated form it appears as powders, pastes, or dark broths with a strong, rich smell.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Foods rich in amino acids and nucleotides such as fungi, seaweed, ripe tomatoes, cured meats, and dried fish.
- Signs: A savory taste that lingers and increases salivation.
- It is a natural material concentrated through processing.

### Minimum processing required

- Drying: Lowers moisture and concentrates flavor compounds.
- Reduction: Slow simmering of broths to intensify umami.
- Fermentation: Increases available glutamates in pastes or sauces.
- Storage: Keep in dry, sealed **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** or **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for powders.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for reduction or gentle roasting.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.

### Common forms of use

- Concentrated broth bases for stews.
- Dried fungi powders blended with **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)**.
- Fermented pastes used as seasoning.
- Reduced sauces to reinforce flavor.

### Possible substitutes

- Aromatic **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)** to offset some depth.
- **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** for enhancement, though without body.
- Roasting or smoking for stronger notes.

### Limitations and common failures

- Intensity loss: Prolonged heat can degrade compounds.
- Moisture damage: Concentrates spoil if they absorb water.
- Overuse: Can overwhelm other flavors.

### Risks and safety

- High salinity: Many concentrates are salty.
- Allergies: Fungi or seafood ingredients can trigger reactions.
- Poor fermentation control: Can produce off-flavors or contamination.

### Related materials

- **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)**: Combined for complex flavor.
- **[Fungi](/en/materials/fungi)**: A common umami source.
- **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**: Enhances umami perception.
