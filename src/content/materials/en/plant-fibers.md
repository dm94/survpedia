Plant fibers are elongated cells found in many plants, especially in the stems (bast fibers), leaves, or around seeds. They are primarily composed of cellulose.

## Description of what it is like

Plant fibers are typically thin, hair-like strands. They can be soft (like cotton) or coarse and stiff (like hemp or sisal). They are flexible and can be twisted together to form stronger strands.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Fields, forests, and wetlands.
- Signs: Fibrous stems of plants like flax, hemp, nettles, or the leaves of agave and yucca.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Harvesting: Cutting the source plants.
- Retting: Soaking in water to rot away the non-fibrous parts.
- Decortication/Scraping: Separating the fibers from the rest of the plant material.
- Combing/Carding: Aligning the fibers for spinning.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Knives or sickles for harvesting.
- Retting tanks or ponds.
- Scrapers or beaters.
- Spindles or spinning wheels for making thread/rope.

### Common forms of use

- Raw: As simple bindings or nesting material.
- Processed: Spun into thread, yarn, or rope.
- Woven: Into fabrics and textiles.

### Possible substitutes

- Animal Fibers: Wool or silk.
- Synthetic Fibers: Nylon or polyester.
- Leather: For some binding and clothing applications.

### Limitations and common failures

- Rot: Natural fibers will decay if kept wet for too long.
- Low Fire Resistance: Most plant fibers are highly flammable.
- Elasticity: Some fibers stretch or shrink significantly when wet.

### Risks and safety

- Dust: Inhaling fine fibers can cause respiratory issues.
- Irritation: Some fiber-producing plants (like nettles) can cause skin irritation during harvesting.

### Related materials

- Cotton: A specific and very common plant fiber.
- Wood: Also contains cellulose fibers but in a rigid matrix.
- Paper: Often made from processed plant fibers.
