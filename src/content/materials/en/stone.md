Stone is a hard and compact mineral substance. Geologists use the term rock. It has been the fundamental building block of human technology for millennia.

## Description of what it is like

Stone is generally hard, cold to the touch, and non-malleable. It comes in various textures from smooth river pebbles to rough volcanic rock.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Mountains, riverbeds, quarries, and almost anywhere on the Earth's surface.
- Signs: Visible outcroppings or loose fragments on the ground.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Cleaning: Removing dirt or organic matter.
- Shaping: Knapping for tools or cutting/dressing for construction.
- Grinding: To smooth surfaces or sharpen edges.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Other stones (hammers and anvils).
- Metal chisels and hammers (for more advanced work).
- Abrasives like sand and water for polishing.

### Common forms of use

- Raw: As weights or simple building blocks.
- Processed: Carved into tools, weapons, decorative items, or millstones.
- Combined: With mortar for masonry.

### Possible substitutes

- Brick or Concrete: For construction.
- Metal or Bone: For tools and weapons.
- Ceramics: For smaller objects.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittleness: Can crack or shatter under impact.
- Weight: Difficult to transport in large quantities.
- Weathering: Some types (like limestone) can be eroded by acidic rain over long periods.

### Risks and safety

- Physical hazards: Heavy stones can cause crushing injuries.
- Dust: Inhaling stone dust (silica) during cutting can lead to lung disease (silicosis).
- Sharp edges: Knapped stone (like flint) can be extremely sharp and cause deep cuts.

### Related materials

- Flint: A specific type of stone excellent for sharp tools.
- Sand: Small fragments of stone.
- Clay: Often found in similar geological contexts.
