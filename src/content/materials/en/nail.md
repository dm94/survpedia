A nail is a small metal spike with a broad flat head, driven into wood to join things together. It is one of the most fundamental fasteners in construction.

## Description of what it is like

Nails are typically made of metal (**[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**). They have a sharp point at one end, a slender shank, and a flattened head at the other. The shank may be smooth or have ridges (rings or spirals) to increase holding power.

## Origin and where to find it

Nails are manufactured products.

- **Hand-forged nails:** Made by heating an iron rod in a **[Forge](/en/inventions/forge)** and hammering it into shape. Identify them by their square shank and irregular head.
- **Cut nails:** Sheared from a metal plate. Rectangular in cross-section.
- **Wire nails:** Made from coil wire. Round in cross-section. The most common modern type.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mining & Smelting:** Obtain the metal (**[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**).
2.  **Forming:**
    - **Forging:** Heat the rod, taper the point, cut to length, and upset the end to form the head.
    - **Wire Drawing:** Draw metal through dies to create wire, then cut and head it by machine.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer):** Essential for driving nails.
- **[Pliers](/en/inventions/pliers):** For removing or bending nails.
- **[Forge](/en/inventions/forge) & [Anvil](/en/inventions/anvil):** For making nails manually.

### Common forms of use

- **Framing:** Joining 2x4s and structural members.
- **Sheathing:** Attaching plywood or boards to the frame.
- **Finishing:** Small nails with minimal heads for trim work.
- **Roofing:** Large-headed nails for securing shingles or felt.

### Possible substitutes

- **Wooden Pegs (Treenails):** Traditional method for timber framing. Requires drilling holes.
- **Lashing:** Using **[Rope](/en/materials/rope)** or cordage to bind members together.
- **Screws:** Provide better holding power but are harder to make/install without modern tools.
- **[Glue](/en/materials/glue):** For smaller joints or in combination with other fasteners.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rust:** Iron nails rust quickly in damp conditions. Use galvanized or stainless steel for exterior use.
- **Splitting:** Driving a large nail into thin wood can split the grain. Blunting the point helps reduce this.
- **Withdrawal:** Nails can pull out over time due to wood movement (expansion/contraction).
- **Shear:** Nails are strong in shear (sideways force) but weak in tension (pulling out).

### Risks and safety

- **Tetanus:** Rusty nails can cause puncture wounds that are prone to infection.
- **Eye Injury:** Nails can fly or chip when struck.
- **Hammer Blows:** Risk of hitting fingers.
