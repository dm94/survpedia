Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. It is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements.

## Description of what it is like

Coal is a hard, black, rock-like substance. It is heavy and often dusty. When burned, it provides intense, sustained heat.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Deep underground or in surface outcrops where sedimentary rocks are present.
- Signs: Black veins in rock faces, black dust in riverbeds near coal seams.
- It is a natural material that requires extraction (mining).

### Minimum processing required

- Mining: Extracting the coal from the ground.
- Cleaning: Removing non-combustible rock and impurities.
- Sorting: Breaking into uniform sizes for different uses.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Picks, shovels, and hammers for extraction.
- Carts or bags for transportation.
- Ventilation systems (for underground mining).

### Common forms of use

- Lump coal: For domestic heating and early steam engines.
- Pulverized coal: For modern power plants.
- Coke: Coal that has been heated without air to remove volatile components, used in steelmaking.

### Possible substitutes

- Charcoal: Produced from wood, though less energy-dense.
- Wood: More abundant but less efficient for high-heat applications.
- Natural Gas or Oil: Modern liquid/gaseous fuels.

### Limitations and common failures

- Smoke: Produces significant soot and smoke when burned.
- Ash: Leaves behind solid residue that must be cleared.
- Non-renewable: Once a seam is mined, it is gone.

### Risks and safety

- Toxic Gases: Mining and burning coal releases carbon monoxide and other harmful gases.
- Explosions: Coal dust in mines is highly explosive.
- Respiratory Issues: Inhaling coal dust leads to serious lung diseases (black lung).

### Related materials

- Carbon: The primary element.
- Charcoal: The synthetic version made from wood.
- Steel: Coal (as coke) is essential for its production.
