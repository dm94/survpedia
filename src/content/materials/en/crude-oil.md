Crude oil is a naturally occurring liquid mixture of hydrocarbons formed from ancient biological material under heat and pressure.

## Description of what it is like

It ranges from light and flowable to thick and tar-like, often dark brown or black. It has a strong odor, repels water, and burns readily when ignited.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural seeps**: Oil leaks from the ground or seabed in some regions.
- **Sedimentary basins**: Trapped in porous rock layers under impermeable caps.
- **Associated gas**: Often found with natural gas that must be vented or captured.

### Minimum processing required

- **Settling**: Let water and sediment separate in containers.
- **Filtration**: Strain with cloth or sand to reduce grit.
- **Warming**: Gently heat to lower viscosity for handling.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Containers**: Heat-safe pots or barrels for settling and storage.
- **Screens or cloth**: For coarse filtration.
- **Pumps**: To move thick oil when gravity flow is insufficient.

### Common forms of use

- **Raw feedstock**: Distilled into lighter and heavier fractions.
- **Heavy residue**: Used for waterproofing or binding aggregates.
- **Blends**: Mixed with sand and gravel for paving materials.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Basic fuel and lubricant substitute, but solid at room temperature.
- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**: Renewable substitute for lamps and light lubrication.
- **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**: For waterproofing and adhesive uses.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Variability**: Composition varies by source, affecting yield and quality.
- **Contamination**: Water and sediment reduce usefulness and increase smoke.
- **Cold flow**: Heavy crude becomes too viscous in cold climates.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire hazard**: Vapors can ignite; keep away from open flames during handling.
- **Toxic fumes**: Heating produces harmful vapors; work outdoors or vent well.
- **Environmental damage**: Spills persist and spread quickly.

### Related materials

- **[Bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen)**: Heavy fraction or residue of crude oil.
- **[Asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt)**: Bitumen mixed with aggregate for paving.
