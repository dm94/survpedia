# Brief description

Feathers are epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and are essential for flight, insulation, and waterproofing.

## Properties

- **Lightweight & Strong**: High strength-to-weight ratio due to their keratin structure.
- **Aerodynamic**: The vane structure creates a surface that pushes against air, essential for flight and stabilizing projectiles.
- **Insulating**: Traps air close to the body, providing excellent thermal regulation.
- **Water-resistant**: Often coated in natural oils that repel water.

## Uses

- **Fletching**: Essential for stabilizing arrows and darts in flight.
- **Insulation**: Used in clothing and bedding (down) to retain heat.
- **Writing**: The quill (calamus) can be cut to hold ink for writing.
- **Decoration**: Used in ceremonial dress and ornamentation.

## Source

Feathers are naturally obtained from birds. They can be collected when birds molt (shed old feathers) or plucked from domesticated or hunted birds (e.g., chickens, geese, ducks).
