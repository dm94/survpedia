# Description

A pink to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminum oxide). It is one of the hardest natural minerals.

## Description of what it is like

Hard, crystalline stone with a red hue. Transparent to translucent.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural:** Found in marble layers, basalt, or alluvial deposits (riverbeds).
- **Synthetic:** Can be created in labs (flame fusion) for industrial use.

### Minimum processing required

- **Cutting/Polishing:** To shape for jewelry or bearings.
- **Drilling:** For use as watch jewels (requires diamond dust).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Diamond tools:** Only diamond is harder and can cut/polish ruby effectively.

### Common forms of use

- **Jewel Bearings:** Tiny donuts of synthetic ruby used to reduce friction in watch gears.
- **Gemstones:** Cut and polished for ornamentation.

### Possible substitutes

- **Sapphire:** Another variety of corundum, identical properties but different color.
- **Glass:** Much softer, wears out quickly.
- **Brass/Bronze:** Metal bushings (higher friction than jewels).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittle:** Can chip or shatter upon hard impact despite hardness.

### Risks and safety

- **None:** Chemically inert and safe.
