Vegetable oil is a triglyceride extracted from plants, commonly from seeds, nuts, or fruits. It is a fundamental material for nutrition, lighting, and primitive chemical engineering.

## Description of what it is like

A viscous liquid at room temperature, usually ranging in color from clear to yellow or green. It feels greasy and slippery. Unlike animal fat, it usually remains liquid in cooler temperatures.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Agricultural lands, wild groves (olives, nuts).
- **Sources**: Olives, sunflower seeds, rapeseed, flaxseeds, walnuts, coconuts.
- **Natural**: Contained within the seeds/fruit but requires extraction.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Collecting the oil-rich seeds or fruits.
- **Grinding**: Crushing the material into a paste using a **[Mill](/en/inventions/mill)** or **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)**.
- **Pressing**: Applying high pressure to the paste to squeeze out the oil.
- **Decanting**: Letting the oil sit so impurities settle at the bottom.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**: For crushing.
- **[Mechanical Press](/en/inventions/mechanical-press)**: Essential for efficient extraction.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**: For collection and storage.
- **Cloth**: For filtering.

### Common forms of use

- **Edible Oil**: For frying and dressing food.
- **Lamp Oil**: Fuel for simple wick lamps.
- **Infused Oil**: Base for **[Medicinal Plants](/en/materials/medicinal-plants)** extracts.
- **Wood Treatment**: Protective coating for wood.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Can be used for cooking, fuel, and soap, but is solid at room temperature.
- **Petroleum products**: For lubrication and fuel (modern).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rancidity**: Oxidizes and spoils if exposed to light, heat, or air for too long.
- **Extraction Efficiency**: Without a good press, getting oil is very labor-intensive and wasteful.
- **Smoke Point**: Different oils burn at different temperatures; some smoke easily when heated.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Highly flammable, especially when heated. Oil fires cannot be put out with water.
- **Spoilage**: Consuming rancid oil is unhealthy.

### Related materials

- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: The animal counterpart.
- **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**: Made from oil and alkali.
- **[Medicinal Plants](/en/materials/medicinal-plants)**: Often infused into oil.
