Antimony is a lustrous gray metalloid. While brittle on its own, its most valuable property in technology is its ability to harden other metals, particularly lead.

## Description of what it is like

Antimony is a silvery, shiny, and brittle material. Unlike most metals, it is not malleable; hitting it with a hammer will shatter it into crystals. It has a distinctive property of expanding slightly as it cools from a liquid to a solid.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Found in hydrothermal veins.
- Signs: Stibnite, the primary ore, often forms long, lead-gray, needle-like crystals.
- It is a natural material that requires smelting.

### Minimum processing required

- Liquation: Heating the ore just enough to melt the stibnite and separate it from the rocky gangue.
- Roasting: Converting the sulfide to an oxide.
- Reduction: Heating the oxide with charcoal to produce metallic antimony.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Furnaces and crucibles.
- Molds for alloying.
- Mortar and pestle for crushing brittle ore.

### Common forms of use

- Type Metal: An alloy of lead, tin, and antimony. The antimony adds hardness and ensures the metal expands to fill every detail of the mold.
- Babbitt Metal: Used for bearings.
- Hardened Lead: For bullets or battery plates.

### Possible substitutes

- Arsenic: Also hardens lead but is much more toxic.
- Calcium: Used in some modern lead alloys.
- Tin: Provides some hardening but less than antimony.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittleness: Cannot be used alone for any structural purpose.
- Impurities: Small amounts of arsenic are often present in antimony ores.

### Risks and safety

- Toxicity: Antimony and its compounds are toxic. Avoid inhaling dust or fumes.
- Irritation: Can cause skin and eye irritation.

### Related materials

- Lead: The primary metal that antimony is used to harden.
- Tin: Often used together with lead and antimony in alloys.
- Charcoal: Used in the reduction process.
