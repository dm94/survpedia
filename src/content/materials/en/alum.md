Alum (specifically Potassium Alum) is a naturally occurring mineral salt that has been a cornerstone of chemical technology since antiquity. It is a double sulfate of potassium and aluminum, typically found as colorless, odorless crystals.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as transparent or white crystals or powder. It has a sweetish, astringent taste. It dissolves easily in hot water but crystallizes out as the water cools.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Volcanic regions, solfataras, and areas with oxidation of sulfide minerals.
- **Signs**: White crusts on rocks in volcanic areas, or specific minerals like Alunite (alum stone).
- **Natural**: Can be found in pure form in desert environments or extracted from alum-bearing rocks (shales).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mining**: Extracting alunite or alum shale.
2.  **Roasting**: Heating the ore to convert aluminum compounds into soluble sulfates.
3.  **Leaching**: Dissolving the roasted ore in water.
4.  **Crystallization**: Evaporating the water to let pure alum crystals form.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pickaxe**: For mining.
- **Kiln/Fire**: For roasting the ore.
- **Vats/Pots**: For leaching and crystallization.

### Common forms of use

- **Crystal**: Rubbed directly on skin (deodorant, styptic).
- **Powder**: Dissolved in water for dyeing or [tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning) baths.
- **Solution**: Added to muddy water to clarify it (flocculation).

### Possible substitutes

- **Iron Sulfate (Copperas)**: For darkening dyes (sadness).
- **Copper Sulfate**: For green/blue hues (toxic).
- **Tannins**: For tanning and some dyeing (though they act differently).
- **Urine**: Historical mordant/modifier.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Solubility**: Washes away in rain if exposed.
- **Purity**: Impurities (like iron) can ruin dye colors (turning reds to browns).

### Risks and safety

- **Irritation**: Can dry out skin and mucous membranes.
- **Ingestion**: Mildly toxic in large quantities.

### Related materials

- **[Textile Dye](/en/materials/textile-dye)**: Alum is the primary mordant for bright colors.
- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**: Used in [tawing](/en/knowledge/tanning) (making white leather).
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: Used to purify drinking water.
