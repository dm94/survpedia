Peanut is an oil-rich legume seed from Arachis hypogaea, widely cultivated in warm climates for food and oil.

## Description of what it is like

The seeds are oval and beige with a thin reddish skin. When roasted they become aromatic and crunchy, and they feel oily to the touch.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Tropical and subtropical fields with well-drained, sandy soils.
- Signs: Low bushy plants with yellow flowers; pods develop underground and contain 1–4 seeds.
- It is a cultivated crop that grows naturally in warm climates.

### Minimum processing required

- Harvesting: Uproot plants when foliage yellows and pods are mature.
- Drying: Cure pods in shade with airflow to reduce moisture.
- Shelling: Remove the pods to access the seeds.
- Roasting or boiling: Optional for flavor and digestibility.
- Pressing: Crush and press for **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Digging tools for harvesting.
- Drying racks or mats for curing.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage and transport.
- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for peanut flour.
- **[Mechanical Press](/en/inventions/mechanical-press)** for oil extraction.

### Common forms of use

- Roasted or boiled peanuts.
- Peanut paste and peanut flour.
- Peanut meal for animal feed.
- Oil for cooking and preservation.

### Possible substitutes

- Other oilseeds and nuts.
- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** for cooking and soap making.
- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** from other crops.

### Limitations and common failures

- Mold: Damp storage can lead to aflatoxin contamination.
- Rancidity: Oils oxidize if exposed to heat, light, or air.
- Pests: Rodents and insects are attracted to stored nuts.

### Risks and safety

- Allergies: Peanut allergy can be severe.
- Choking hazard: Whole nuts can be dangerous for small children.
- Food safety: Spoiled or moldy peanuts should be discarded.
