Potato is a calorie-dense tuber that grows underground and provides a reliable food source in cool climates.

## Description of what it is like

Round or elongated tubers with thin skins and white or yellow flesh. They soften quickly when cooked and can be mashed or dried.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Cool to temperate fields and highland soils.
- Signs: Low plants with small flowers and underground tubers.
- It is a cultivated crop often grown in ridged rows.

### Minimum processing required

- Harvesting: Dig out tubers when foliage dies back.
- Curing: Dry the skins in shade for longer storage.
- Storage: Keep cool, dark, and dry to slow sprouting.
- Cooking: Boil, roast, or steam to make digestible.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Digging tools for harvest.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for cooking and drying.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** for making flour or mash.

### Common forms of use

- Boiled or roasted potatoes.
- Mashed potatoes and soups.
- Dried flakes or flour for storage.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** as a starchy root.
- **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)** or **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)** as grains.

### Limitations and common failures

- Storage rot: Warm or damp storage causes decay.
- Frost damage: Cold snaps reduce yield and storage life.
- Sprouting: Increases bitterness and reduces food quality.

### Risks and safety

- Solanine: Green or sprouting potatoes can be toxic.
- Spoilage: Soft, wet, or moldy tubers should be discarded.
