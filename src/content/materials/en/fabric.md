Fabric is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers (yarn or thread). It is essential for protection, transport, and comfort.

## Physical Description

Fabric appears as a continuous sheet of interlaced threads. Its texture, weight, and strength depend on the fiber used (cotton, wool, flax) and the method of construction (weave type).

## Origin and Where to Find It

- **Environment:** Created in settlements with weaving capabilities (looms).
- **Signs:** Look for spinning wheels, looms, or trade goods.
- It is a processed material.

### Minimum Processing Required

1.  **Spinning:** Twisting fibers into yarn or thread.
2.  **Weaving/Knitting:** Interlacing the yarn on a loom or with needles to form the fabric.
3.  **Finishing:** Washing, bleaching, or dyeing.

### Tools Needed for Working It

- **Spindle/Spinning Wheel:** For making thread.
- **Loom:** For weaving fabric.
- **Needles/Scissors:** For cutting and sewing.

### Common Forms of Use

- **Canvas:** Heavy-duty fabric for sails and tents.
- **Cloth:** General purpose for clothing.
- **Gauze:** Light, open weave for bandages.

### Possible Substitutes

- **Leather/Furs:** For clothing and protection (warmer but less breathable).
- **Bark cloth:** Beaten bark (primitive).
- **Plastic sheets:** Modern substitute for waterproofing.

### Limits and Common Failures

- **Tearing:** Can rip under stress.
- **Rot:** Natural fibers decay in damp conditions.
- **Flammability:** Most natural fabrics burn easily.

### Risks and Safety

- **Entanglement:** Loose fabric can catch in machinery.
- **Flammability:** Keep away from open flames unless treated.

### Related Materials

- **Plant Fibers:** Raw material (cotton, flax, hemp).
