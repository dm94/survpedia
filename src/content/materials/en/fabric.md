Fabric is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers (yarn or thread). It is essential for protection, transport, and comfort.

## Physical Description

Fabric appears as a continuous sheet of interlaced threads. Its texture, weight, and strength depend on the fiber used (cotton, wool, flax) and the method of construction (weave type).

## Origin and Where to Find It

- **Environment:** Created in settlements with weaving capabilities (looms).
- **Signs:** Look for spinning wheels, looms, or trade goods.
- It is a processed material.

### Minimum Processing Required

1.  **Spinning:** Twisting fibers into yarn or thread.
2.  **Weaving/Knitting:** Interlacing the yarn on a loom or with needles to form the fabric.
3.  **Finishing:** Washing, bleaching, or dyeing.

### Tools Needed for Working It

- **[Spindle](/en/inventions/spindle)**/**[Spinning Wheel](/en/inventions/spinning-wheel):** For making thread.
- **[Loom](/en/inventions/loom):** For weaving fabric.
- **Needles/Scissors:** For manual cutting and sewing.
- **[Sewing Machine](/en/inventions/sewing-machine):** For rapid and precise stitching.

### Common Forms of Use

- **Canvas:** Heavy-duty fabric for sails and tents.
- **Cloth:** General purpose for clothing.
- **Gauze:** Light, open weave for bandages.

### Possible Substitutes

- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**: Animal skins (durable, waterproof, but harder to sew).
- **Bark Cloth (Tapa)**: Beaten inner bark of certain trees.
- **Furs/Pelts**: For warmth.
- **Woven Mats**: Grass or reed mats for shelter or sleeping.
- **Plastic Sheets**: Modern substitute for waterproofing.

### Limits and Risks

- **Flammability**: Most natural fabrics burn easily. Keep away from open flames.
- **Rot/Mold**: Organic fibers decay if kept damp.
- **Pests**: Moths and insects can eat wool or cotton.
- **Wear**: Tears and fraying require constant repair (darning).
- **Entanglement**: Loose fabric can catch in machinery.
