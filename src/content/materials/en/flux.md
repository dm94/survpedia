Flux is a chemical cleaning agent, flowing agent, or purifying agent. Fluxes may have more than one function at a time. They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining.

## Description of what it is like

Flux can appear as a powder, paste, or liquid, depending on its specific type and application. Common fluxes include silica sand, borax, limestone, and rosin.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Sand (Silica)**: Found in riverbeds, beaches, and deserts.
- **Limestone**: Sedimentary rock found in mountains and cliffs.
- **Borax**: Found in dry lake beds (evaporite deposits).
- **Rosin**: Derived from pine tree resin.
- **Ash**: Wood ash can sometimes act as a flux due to potash content.

### Minimum processing required

- **Grinding**: Most solid fluxes like limestone and sand need to be ground into a fine powder.
- **Purification**: Some natural sources may need washing or refining to remove impurities that could contaminate the metal.
- **Mixing**: Sometimes mixed with water or oil to form a paste.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mortar and Pestle**: For grinding solid minerals.
- **Containers**: For storing the powder or paste.
- **Sieve**: To ensure uniform particle size.

### Common forms of use

- **Powder**: Sprinkled onto hot metal during forge welding.
- **Paste**: Applied to joints before soldering.
- **Additive**: Mixed with ore in a furnace during smelting.

### Possible substitutes

- **Sand**: Can substitute for borax in forge welding iron, though higher temperatures are needed.
- **Ash**: Wood ash or straw ash can work in some clay or glass processes.
- **Glass**: Ground glass can act as a flux.
- **Animal Fat**: Can be used in soldering lead (primitive).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Incorrect Type**: Using the wrong flux for the metal (e.g., using rosin for iron welding) will result in failure.
- **Contamination**: Dirty flux can introduce impurities.
- **Moisture**: Damp flux can cause steam explosions or porosity in the weld.

### Risks and safety

- **Fumes**: Fluxes often release toxic fumes when heated (e.g., fluoride fumes). Ventilation is critical.
- **Corrosivity**: Some fluxes are acidic and can corrode the metal if not cleaned off after use.
- **Burns**: Flux becomes molten and sticky at high temperatures.
