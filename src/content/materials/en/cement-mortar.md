Cement mortar is a mixture of **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, and **[Water](/en/materials/water)**. It is the standard bonding agent for modern masonry, providing high strength and water resistance. Unlike lime mortar, it sets quickly and becomes very hard and rigid.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as a grey, sandy paste when fresh. It is heavier and less sticky than lime mortar. Once hardened, it becomes a rock-hard solid, grey in color, with a rough texture depending on the sand used. It is significantly harder than traditional lime mortars.

## Origin and where to find it

It is a synthetic material created on-site or in a factory.

- **Raw Materials:**
  - **[Cement](/en/materials/cement):** The binder (usually Portland cement).
  - **[Sand](/en/materials/sand):** The aggregate (must be clean and sharp).
  - **[Water](/en/materials/water):** The activator.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Selection:** Choose clean sand (washed) and fresh cement (no lumps).
2.  **Dry Mixing:** Mix cement and sand thoroughly in a dry state to ensure even distribution. Common ratios are 1 part cement to 3-5 parts sand.
3.  **Hydration:** Add water gradually while mixing.
4.  **Mixing:** Work the mixture until it reaches a uniform, plastic consistency. It should hold its shape when formed into a ball but spread easily with a trowel.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Shovel/Hoe:** For mixing large batches.
- **Wheelbarrow/Mixing Tub:** Container for mixing.
- **Trowel:** For applying and shaping the mortar.
- **Hawk:** For holding a small amount of mortar while working.
- **Gloves:** Essential to prevent chemical burns.

### Common forms of use

- **Masonry Mortar:** Used to bond **[Bricks](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Concrete Blocks](/en/materials/concrete-block)**, and stones.
- **Rendering/Plastering:** Applied to walls to provide a weather-resistant finish.
- **Screeding:** Creating smooth, level floors.
- **Grouting:** Filling gaps between tiles or masonry units.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Lime](/en/materials/lime) Mortar:** More flexible and breathable, better for historic restoration and soft bricks.
- **Mud Mortar:** **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** and sand. Weaker, water-soluble, but easy to make.
- **Gypsum Mortar:** For dry, interior locations only.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rigidity:** It is very rigid and brittle. If the building moves (settles), the mortar will crack rather than flex.
- **Incompatibility:** It should **not** be used with soft, historic bricks or stone. The mortar is harder than the units, causing the bricks to crack under stress instead of the mortar joint.
- **Shrinkage:** Can shrink during curing, potentially causing separation cracks.
- **Pot Life:** Sets relatively quickly (1-2 hours), so it must be used soon after mixing.

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical Burns:** Wet cement is highly alkaline (pH ~12-13) and can cause severe skin burns and eye damage. **Always wear waterproof gloves and eye protection.**
- **Dermatitis:** Prolonged contact can cause allergic reactions.
- **Silica Dust:** Mixing dry ingredients creates dust containing crystalline silica, which is harmful to lungs. Wear a mask.
