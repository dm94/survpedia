Cutting fluid is a type of coolant and lubricant designed specifically for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. It is essential for high-speed machining to prevent tool failure and improve surface finish.

## Description of what it is like

It can be a neat oil (clear or dark), a soluble oil emulsion (milky white), or a synthetic fluid (clear or colored). It feels slippery and has a distinct chemical or oily smell.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic:** Created by mixing specific oils and chemicals.
- **Natural base:** Can be made from animal fats (lard) or vegetable oils, often mixed with water and soap.

### Minimum processing required

- **Neat Oil:** Use **[Lard Oil](/en/materials/animal-fat)** or **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** directly for slow, heavy cuts (like threading).
- **Soluble Oil (Emulsion):** Mix oil with an emulsifier (like **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**) and then whisk into water. This provides the cooling of water with the lubrication of oil.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**: For mixing.
- **Pump/Squirt Bottle:** To apply it to the cutting zone.

### Common forms of use

- **Flood Coolant:** Pumped continuously over the tool and workpiece.
- **Mist Coolant:** Sprayed as a fine mist (uses less fluid but bad for lungs).
- **Hand Applied:** Brushed or squirted on for manual machines.

### Possible substitutes

- **Water:** Great cooling, zero lubrication, causes rust immediately. (Add **[Soda Ash](/en/materials/ash)** to reduce rust).
- **Kerosene/Diesel:** Good for aluminum and finishing steel (flammable!).
- **Dry Machining:** Possible with carbide tools, but generates immense heat.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Bacteria:** Soluble oils can grow bacteria and smell like rotten eggs. Require aeration or biocides.
- **Evaporation:** Water evaporates, changing the concentration.
- **Rust:** If the mix is too lean (too much water), the machine will rust.

### Risks and safety

- **Dermatitis:** Prolonged skin contact causes rashes.
- **Inhalation:** Breathing mist is bad for lungs.
- **Fire:** Neat oils can catch fire if the machining gets too hot.

### Related materials

- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**: Base for bio-fluids.
- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Lard is an excellent tapping fluid.
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: The main component of coolants.
- **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**: Emulsifier.
