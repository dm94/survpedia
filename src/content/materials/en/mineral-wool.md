Mineral wool (also known as rock wool or stone wool) is a fibrous material formed by spinning or drawing molten mineral or rock materials. It is superior to fiberglass in fire resistance and density.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as greenish-brown or gray dense mats of fibers. It is heavier and denser than fiberglass. It can be found in rolls (blankets), rigid slabs (batts), or loose-fill. It feels slightly prickly to the touch but less irritating than glass wool.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic**: Produced in industrial furnaces.
- **Raw Materials**: Basalt (volcanic rock), diabase, or blast furnace slag (waste from steel production).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Melting**: Rock and coke are melted in a cupola furnace at approx 1500°C.
2.  **Spinning**: The molten lava is poured onto rapidly spinning wheels which fling droplets into fibers (like cotton candy).
3.  **Binding**: A binder and oil are added to hold fibers together and reduce dust.
4.  **Curing**: The mat is heated to cure the binder.
5.  **Cutting**: Sliced into batts or rolls.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Serrated Knife**: To cut the batts to size (it cuts like bread).
- **Protective Gear**: Gloves, long sleeves, and a mask/respirator are recommended to avoid skin irritation and inhaling dust.
- **Tape Measure**: To ensure tight fits between studs.

### Common forms of use

- **Cavity Wall Insulation**: Slabs placed between the inner and outer **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** skins.
- **External Wall Insulation**: Rigid high-density slabs fixed to the outside of **[Masonry](/en/inventions/masonry)**.
- **Fire Protection**: Used to wrap steel beams or fill voids to prevent fire spread (it is non-combustible).
- **Sound Insulation**: High density makes it excellent for blocking noise in partitions.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Fiberglass](/en/materials/fiberglass)**: Cheaper, lighter, but less fire-resistant and poorer sound blocker.
- **[Polystyrene](/en/materials/polystyrene)**: Better moisture resistance for ground contact, but flammable.
- **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**: Natural alternative, requires thicker walls.
- **Sheep's [Wool](/en/materials/wool)**: Natural, breathable, but expensive.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: While treated to be water-repellent, if it gets saturated, it loses insulating value. It must be kept dry.
- **Compression**: Should not be compressed into a space too small, or it loses air pockets (though less prone to this than fiberglass).
- **Weight**: Heavier than other insulations, requires support.

### Risks and safety

- **Irritation**: Can cause temporary skin itching and eye irritation.
- **Dust**: Inhalation of fibers should be avoided; wear a mask. unlike asbestos, the fibers are bio-soluble (lung clears them), but high exposure is still harmful.

### Related inventions

- **[Furnace](/en/inventions/furnace)**: Required for melting the rock.
- **[Masonry](/en/inventions/masonry)**: Often used in conjunction with brick and block walls.
