Textile dyes are substances capable of chemically bonding with fibers to impart permanent color. Unlike pigments (which sit on the surface), dyes penetrate the fiber structure.

## Description of what it is like

Usually found as a colored liquid bath during the process, or as dried powders/pastes of the raw dyestuff. The color of the dye bath is often different from the final color on the fabric due to chemical reactions with the mordant.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Plants**: Roots (Madder - Red), Leaves (Indigo/Woad - Blue, Weld - Yellow), Flowers (Saffron - Yellow), Bark (Oak - Brown/Black).
- **Insects**: Cochineal or Kermes (on cacti/oaks) produce intense reds.
- **Minerals**: Iron oxide (rust) or copper salts.
- **Mollusks**: Murex snails (Purple).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection**: Gathering the plant parts or insects.
2.  **Extraction**: Chopping and boiling in water to release the color. Fermentation is required for some dyes like Indigo.
3.  **Mordanting**: Treating the fabric with a metal salt (like Alum) so the dye can bite (bind) to it.
4.  **Dyeing**: Simmering the fabric in the dye bath.
5.  **Washing**: Removing excess dye.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pots/Vats**: Non-reactive (ceramic or stainless steel preferred) for boiling.
- **Stirring sticks**: Wood or glass.
- **Grinding tools**: Pestle and mortar for roots/insects.
- **Thermometer**: Helpful but not strictly necessary (simmering point).

### Common forms of use

- **Immersion Dyeing**: Dipping the whole fabric/yarn.
- **Tie-Dye/Resist**: Blocking areas with wax or string to create patterns.
- **Painting**: Applying thickened dye directly.

### Possible substitutes

- **Stains**: Berry juices (often fade quickly/wash out).
- **Pigments**: Earths mixed with binders (paint), stiffer and can crack.
- **Smoke**: Smoking skins/fabric imparts a yellow/brown color and waterproofing.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Fading**: Sunlight (UV) destroys many natural colors.
- **Wash fastness**: Without mordants, colors bleed or wash out.
- **Material specificity**: Wool/Silk (protein) dye easily; Cotton/Linen (cellulose) are harder to dye.

### Risks and safety

- **Toxicity**: Some mordants (Chrome, Tin, Copper) are toxic. Some dye plants are poisonous.
- **Burns**: Handling large pots of boiling water.
