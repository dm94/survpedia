Biofuel is energy-rich fuel derived from recent biomass rather than fossil sources. It includes liquids like ethanol and biodiesel, as well as solid and gaseous fuels made from plant or animal material.

## Description of what it is like

Biofuels vary by type. Ethanol is a clear, volatile liquid that mixes with water. Biodiesel is an oily liquid with a mild smell and higher viscosity than gasoline. Solid biofuels are dry, fibrous, or pelletized plant matter.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Farms, forests, and food processing areas with abundant plant material or animal fats.
- **Signs**: Fermented mash, pressed seed cakes, oily residues, or stored dry biomass.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Ethanol**: Ferment sugars with **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**, then separate with **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)**.
- **Biodiesel**: Extract **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** and convert with an alcohol and catalyst.
- **Solid biofuel**: Dry and compress biomass into logs or pellets.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)** vessels and **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)** setup for ethanol.
- **[Mechanical Press](/en/inventions/mechanical-press)** for oil extraction.
- **[Controlled Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for drying and processing.

### Common forms of use

- **Ethanol fuel**: For lamps, stoves, and blended engine fuel.
- **Biodiesel**: For diesel engines or burners.
- **Pellets and briquettes**: For heating and cooking.
- **Biogas**: For cooking or electricity generation when captured.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: Direct fuel for lamps or stoves.
- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**: Can be burned in adapted lamps or engines.
- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Can be burned or turned into tallow-based fuels.
- **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**: Solid fuel when liquid biofuels are unavailable.
- **[Coal](/en/materials/coal)**: Fossil alternative when available.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Water contamination**: Ethanol absorbs water and loses combustion efficiency.
- **Cold gelling**: Biodiesel can thicken and clog filters in cold weather.
- **Energy density**: Lower than gasoline or diesel, reducing range.
- **Feedstock limits**: Competes with food crops or land if not managed.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Highly flammable liquids and vapors.
- **Toxic byproducts**: Poor distillation can concentrate methanol.
- **Spills**: Can contaminate soil and water if unmanaged.

### Related materials

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: Ethanol-based biofuel.
- **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**: Primary biodiesel feedstock.
- **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**: Alternative biodiesel feedstock.
- **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)** and **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**: Fermentation inputs.
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: Fermentation medium and cleaning.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: Common solid biofuel source.
