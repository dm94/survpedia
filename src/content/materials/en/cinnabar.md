Cinnabar (mercury sulfide, HgS) is the bright scarlet to brick-red ore of mercury. It is the most common source of mercury in nature.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Bright red to brownish-red crystals or massive granular aggregates.
- **Streak:** Scarlet.
- **Luster:** Adamantine (diamond-like) to dull.
- **Toxicity:** Contains mercury; handling it is relatively safe if not ingested or heated, but dust is dangerous.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Veins in volcanic regions and hot springs.
- **Signs:** The bright red color is very distinctive.
- **Processing:** Roasting releases mercury.

### Minimum processing required

- **Grinding:** To use as pigment (vermilion).
- **Roasting:** To extract mercury.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hammer/Pick:** For mining.
- **Grinder:** For pigment.
- **Furnace:** For mercury extraction.

### Common forms of use

- **Pigment:** Vermilion (historical, now replaced by cadmium or synthetic reds).
- **Ore:** For mercury extraction.

### Possible substitutes

- **Cadmium Red:** Non-mercury pigment substitute (also toxic).
- **Iron Oxide:** Non-toxic red pigment.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Darkening:** Turns black upon exposure to light over time (metacinnabar).

### Risks and safety

- **Mercury Poisoning:** Releasing vapors when heated.
- **Dust:** Inhalation is dangerous.
