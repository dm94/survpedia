Yeast is a single-celled microorganism classified as a member of the fungus kingdom. The most common species, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, is essential for baking and brewing.

## Description of what it is like

Individually microscopic, yeast colonies appear as a creamy, beige, or off-white paste or powder. It has a distinctive, slightly sour or bready smell.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Naturally occurs on the skins of sugar-rich fruits (grapes, apples), berries, and in the soil.
- **Signs**: Whitish bloom on fruits; spontaneous fermentation of sugary liquids.
- **It is a natural material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection**: Harvesting from fruit skins or established cultures (sourdough starter).
- **Cultivation**: Feeding with flour and water or sugar water to increase biomass.
- **Drying**: For long-term storage (dormancy).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Containers**: Jars or bowls for culturing.
- **Cloth**: To cover cultures while allowing airflow but keeping bugs out.
- **Warmth**: Requires moderate temperatures (20-30°C) to thrive.

### Common forms of use

- **Leavening Agent**: In bread making, it produces CO2 which makes the dough rise.
- **Fermentation Starter**: In brewing and winemaking, it converts sugars into alcohol.
- **Nutritional Yeast**: Deactivated yeast used as a food supplement (rich in B vitamins).

### Possible substitutes

- **Chemical Leaveners**: Baking soda and acid (for baking).
- **Wild Fermentation**: Relying on airborne yeast (less predictable).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Dies at high temperatures (>50-60°C); dormant at low temperatures.
- **Contamination**: Vulnerable to mold or bacteria if not maintained properly.
- **Food Source**: Requires sugar/starch to survive.

### Risks and safety

- **Spoilage**: Can spoil food if unwanted fermentation occurs.
- **Allergies**: Some people are sensitive to yeast.
- **CO2 Production**: Produces gas which can build pressure in sealed containers.
