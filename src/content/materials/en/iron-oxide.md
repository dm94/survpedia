Iron oxide is a chemical compound composed of iron and oxygen. It exists in nature as rust and ores like hematite. In a refined form, it is known as "Jeweler's Rouge" or "Red Rouge," a critical abrasive for achieving optical-quality finishes on glass and metals.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** A fine, dusty powder ranging from bright red (Hematite/Rust) to black (Magnetite) or yellow (Limonite).
- **Texture:** Silky when ground fine, but gritty if impurities remain.
- **Staining:** It stains everything it touches deep red.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural:** Found as red earth (Red Ochre) or hard rocks (Hematite).
- **Synthetic (Rust):** Forms naturally on **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** exposed to **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and air.

### Minimum processing required

To make polishing rouge:

1.  **Rusting:** Allow scrap **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** to rust completely in a bucket of salted water.
2.  **Scraping:** Scrape off the rust scale.
3.  **Washing (Levigation):** Mix the powder with water. Let the heavy coarse particles settle for a few seconds, then pour off the water containing the fine particles into another container. Let that settle. This ensures only the finest particles are used.
4.  **Calcining (Optional):** Heating the powder changes its color (to darker red/purple) and hardness, making it cut faster.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Scrapers:** To remove rust.
- **Containers:** For washing and separating particles.
- **Kiln/Fire:** For calcining (optional).

### Common forms of use

- **Polishing Paste:** Mixed with water or oil to polish **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)**, **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)**, and **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** lenses.
- **Pigment:** Mixed with oil or binder for red paint.
- **Thermite:** Mixed with **[Aluminum](/en/materials/aluminum)** powder to create intense heat for welding.

### Possible substitutes

- **Tripoli (Rottenstone):** Another fine silica-based abrasive.
- **Cerium Oxide:** Modern, faster glass polish (rare earth).
- **Wood Ash:** A very mild abrasive for cleaning, but not optical quality.
- **Toothpaste:** Often contains mild abrasives (chalk/silica) suitable for light polishing.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Contamination:** If a single grain of sand gets into the rouge, it will scratch the workpiece instead of polishing it.
- **Staining:** Difficult to remove from clothes and porous surfaces.

### Risks and safety

- **Inhalation:** Long-term inhalation of iron oxide dust can cause siderosis (benign lung disease).
- **Mess:** It spreads easily and is hard to clean.

- **[Rust](/en/materials/rust):** The crude form.
- **[Sand](/en/materials/sand):** Coarser abrasive.
