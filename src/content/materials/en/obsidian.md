Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass formed when silica-rich lava cools so fast that crystals cannot form. It fractures into razor-sharp edges and can be shaped into precise cutting tools.

## Description of what it is like

It is usually black or dark brown with a glossy, glassy surface. It feels smooth, is brittle under impact, and breaks with conchoidal fractures that create sharp edges.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Volcanic regions, lava flows, and rhyolitic domes.
- **Signs:** Shiny black fragments or glassy nodules mixed with volcanic rock.
- **Natural:** Forms directly from rapid lava cooling.

### Minimum processing required

- **Selection:** Choose dense, glossy pieces without visible cracks.
- **Knapping:** Strike controlled flakes to expose sharp edges.
- **Retouching:** Pressure-flake to refine cutting edges or points.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hammerstone:** For initial flakes.
- **Antler or bone pressure flaker:** For edge refinement.
- **Leather pads:** Hand protection and grip.
- **Abrasive stone:** Smoothing or dulling unsafe edges.

### Common forms of use

- **Flakes and blades:** Knives and scrapers.
- **Points:** Arrowheads and spear tips.
- **Ornaments:** Beads or polished pieces.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Flint](/en/materials/flint):** Similar sharpness, more common in many regions.
- **[Stone](/en/materials/stone):** Works for blunt tools but less sharp.
- **[Bone](/en/materials/bone):** Lighter tools and needles, but less durable.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness:** Shatters under impact or bending forces.
- **Edge fragility:** Extremely sharp but chips easily.
- **Heat sensitivity:** Can crack if heated unevenly or shocked.

### Risks and safety

- **Cuts:** Edges are sharper than steel scalpels.
- **Shards:** Flying flakes can injure eyes or skin.
- **Dust:** Fine particles from knapping can irritate lungs.

### Related materials

- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass):** Similar amorphous structure.
- **[Flint](/en/materials/flint):** Another knapping stone.
- **[Stone](/en/materials/stone):** Common host and alternative.
