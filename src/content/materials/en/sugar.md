Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose.

## Description of what it is like

In its most common form (table sugar or sucrose), it is a white, odorless, crystalline solid. It dissolves easily in water and melts when heated, eventually caramelizing.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Found in the tissues of most plants. High concentrations in sugarcane and sugar beet.
- **Signs**: Sweet taste in fruits, sap, or nectar.
- **It is a natural material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Extraction**: Crushing plant material (cane/beet) to extract juice.
- **Evaporation**: Boiling the juice to remove water and concentrate the sugar.
- **Crystallization**: Allowing the sugar to form crystals as it cools/dries.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Press/Crusher**: To extract juice from the plant.
- **Pot/Cauldron**: For boiling and evaporation.
- **Heat Source**: For evaporation.
- **Container**: For crystallization.

### Common forms of use

- **Preservative**: In high concentrations (jams, jellies), it inhibits bacterial growth.
- **Fermentation**: Essential food source for yeast to produce alcohol.
- **Culinary**: Sweetening foods and beverages.

### Possible substitutes

- **Honey**: A natural, liquid substitute.
- **Fruit Juice**: Concentrated fruit juices can provide similar sugars.
- **Maple Syrup**: Sap from maple trees.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Hygroscopic**: Absorbs moisture from the air, causing clumping.
- **Attracts Pests**: Ants and other insects are drawn to it.
- **Caramelization**: Burns if heated too high without water.

### Risks and safety

- **Health**: Excessive consumption leads to health issues.
- **Flammability**: Fine sugar dust can be explosive in confined spaces.
- **Hot Sugar**: Molten sugar causes severe burns (sugar napalm).

### Related materials

- **Water**: Often used to dissolve sugar.
- **Yeast**: Consumes sugar to produce alcohol and CO2.
- **Alcohol**: Product of sugar fermentation.
