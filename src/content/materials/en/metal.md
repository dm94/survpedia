# Description of what it is like

Metal is a category of materials characterized by being good conductors of heat and electricity, usually hard, opaque, shiny, and malleable (can be hammered into sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Ores:** Most metals are found in rock formations (ores) combined with other elements (oxygen, sulfur).
- **Native Metal:** Some metals like gold, copper, and meteoric iron can be found in their pure metallic form in nature.
- **Scavenging:** Scrap metal from ruins (steel beams, copper pipes, brass fittings) is a primary source in post-collapse scenarios.

### Minimum processing required

- **Smelting:** Heating ore to high temperatures in a furnace to separate the metal from the rock.
- **Refining:** Removing impurities.
- **Alloying:** Mixing metals (e.g., Copper + Tin = Bronze) to improve properties.
- **Forging/Casting:** Shaping the metal using heat and force or molds.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Furnace/Forge:** To reach melting or softening temperatures.
- **Crucible:** To hold molten metal.
- **Anvil & Hammer:** For forging.
- **Files & Abrasives:** For finishing.

### Common forms of use

- **Tools & Weapons:** Knives, axes, hammers, swords (Steel, Iron, Bronze).
- **Cookware:** Pots, pans (Copper, Cast Iron, Stainless Steel).
- **Structure:** Beams, nails, wire (Steel, Iron).
- **Machinery:** Gears, springs, engines (Steel, Brass, Aluminum).

### Possible substitutes

- **Cutting:** Flint, obsidian, glass (sharper but more brittle).
- **Structural:** Wood, stone, bamboo.
- **Fasteners:** Rope, wooden pegs, glue.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Corrosion (Rust):** Iron and steel oxidize in moisture; require oiling or painting.
- **Fatigue:** Repeated stress can cause cracks and failure.
- **Weight:** Heavy compared to wood or plastic.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns:** Working with hot metal poses severe burn risks.
- **Fumes:** Smelting certain ores (like galena for lead) releases toxic fumes.
- **Sharp Edges:** Cut metal can be extremely sharp.
