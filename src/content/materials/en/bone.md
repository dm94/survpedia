Bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. It is a composite material made of both organic (collagen) and inorganic (calcium phosphate) components.

## Description of what it is like

Bone is hard, usually white or off-white, and has a smooth texture when polished. It is less brittle than stone and can be carved or shaped.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Anywhere animals live or have died.
- Signs: Skeletal remains found in nature or obtained from hunted animals.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Cleaning: Removing all flesh, fat, and marrow.
- Degreasing: Boiling or soaking to remove residual oils.
- Bleaching: (Optional) Using sunlight or chemicals for a white appearance.
- Shaping: Sawing, filing, or grinding into the desired form.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Knives and scrapers for cleaning.
- Saws for cutting.
- Files and abrasives for shaping and polishing.
- Drills for making holes.

### Common forms of use

- Raw: As simple hammers or clubs.
- Processed: Carved into needles, hooks, buttons, or handles.
- Ground: Into bone meal for fertilizer.

### Possible substitutes

- Wood: For handles and some tools.
- Stone: For harder tools.
- Plastic: Modern alternative for small items.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittleness: Can snap under extreme pressure.
- Degradation: Will eventually break down if buried in acidic soil.
- Heat Sensitivity: Can become brittle or char if exposed to high heat.

### Risks and safety

- Sharp fragments: Can cause puncture wounds.
- Biological hazards: Raw bone can harbor bacteria if not properly cleaned.
- Dust: Inhaling bone dust during grinding should be avoided.

### Related materials

- Leather: Often obtained from the same animals.
- Antler: Similar to bone but usually denser and grows differently.
- Ivory: A very dense form of bone/tooth material.
