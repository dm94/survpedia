Straw is the dry stalk of cereal plants (wheat, barley, oats, rice) after the grain and chaff have been removed. It is distinct from hay, which is dried grass used for animal feed.

## Description of what it is like

Hollow, yellow or golden tubes. It is light, dry, and brittle. The hollow structure traps air, providing insulation.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Agricultural fields, grasslands.
- **Signs**: Fields of yellow dry stalks after harvest.
- **Harvest**: Collected after the grain harvest.

### Minimum processing required

- **Threshing**: Removing the grain (essential to prevent rotting and rodents).
- **Drying**: Must be completely dry to prevent mold and combustion.
- **Baling/Bundling**: For storage and transport.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Scythe/Sickle**: For cutting the stalks.
- **Rake**: For gathering.
- **Pitchfork**: For moving and stacking.

### Common forms of use

- **Thatching**: Layering straw bundles on roofs to shed water and insulate.
- **Construction**: Mixed with mud to make cob or adobe (provides tensile strength and insulation).
- **Insulation**: Bales used as wall infill (straw-bale construction).
- **Bedding**: For livestock to keep them warm and clean.

### Possible substitutes

- **Reeds**: Better for thatching, more durable.
- **Dried Grass/Hay**: Similar, but hay rots faster due to seed/nutrient content.
- **Leaves**: For temporary insulation.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rot**: Decomposes quickly if wet.
- **Pests**: Attracts mice and insects if grain remains.
- **Durability**: Needs replacement every few years if exposed to weather.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Extremely flammable. A spark can ignite a barn or roof instantly.
- **Dust**: Straw dust can cause respiratory irritation (Farmer's Lung).
