Spices are dried aromatic plant parts used to flavor, preserve, and sometimes medicate food. They are valued for concentrated oils and resins that remain potent after drying.

## Description of what it is like

Usually small, dry pieces such as seeds, bark curls, roots, or pods. Whole spices are hard and fragrant; ground spices are fine powders that release aroma quickly.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Gardens, forest edges, tropical and subtropical farms, spice trees and shrubs.
- Signs: Strong scent when crushed, resinous bark, aromatic seeds, or pungent roots.
- It is a natural material harvested from specific plants.

### Minimum processing required

- Cleaning: Remove dirt, husks, and damaged pieces.
- Drying: Air-dry in shade or gentle heat to prevent mold.
- Sorting: Separate grades by size and aroma.
- Grinding: Pulverize with **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** or **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** when needed.
- Storage: Seal in dry **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** away from light.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Drying racks or woven mats.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** or **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for grinding.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.
- Low, steady heat from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** when sun drying is unreliable.

### Common forms of use

- Whole spices simmered in stews.
- Ground spice powders for seasoning.
- Infused oils or vinegars for preservation.
- Blended spice mixes for cooking or trade.

### Possible substitutes

- Fresh herbs: Good aroma but shorter shelf life.
- **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**: Enhances flavor but lacks aroma.
- Smoke or charred flavorings when spices are unavailable.

### Limitations and common failures

- Aroma loss: Volatile oils fade with heat, light, and air exposure.
- Moisture damage: Damp storage leads to mold or caking.
- Adulteration: Mixed fillers reduce potency.

### Risks and safety

- Irritation: Fine powders can sting eyes and lungs.
- Allergies: Some spices trigger reactions.
- Contamination: Dirty grinders or damp storage can make spices unsafe.
