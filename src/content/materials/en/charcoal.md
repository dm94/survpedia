Charcoal is a lightweight black carbon residue produced by strongly heating wood (or other animal and plant materials) in minimal oxygen to remove all water and volatile constituents.

## Importance

Essential for early metallurgy as it burns hotter than wood, allowing for the smelting of metals. It also serves as an important fuel and filtration medium.
