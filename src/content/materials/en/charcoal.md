Charcoal is a lightweight black carbon residue produced by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and plant materials. It is usually produced by slow pyrolysis—the heating of wood or other organic substances in the absence of oxygen.

## Description of what it is like

Charcoal is black, brittle, and lightweight. It is porous and has a large surface area. It burns hotter and cleaner than wood.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Wherever wood is available.
- **Signs**: Remnants of forest fires; deliberately made in kilns or pits.
- **It is a processed material**: Requires human intervention to create efficiently.

### Minimum processing required

- **Pyrolysis**: Heating wood in a low-oxygen environment (covered pit or kiln).
- **Cooling**: Must be cooled before exposure to air to prevent ignition.
- **Grinding**: For use in gunpowder or filtration.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Kiln or Pit**: To contain the heat and exclude oxygen.
- **Shovel**: For digging pits and moving earth.
- **Grinder/Mortar and Pestle**: To powder it.

### Common forms of use

- **Lump**: As fuel for cooking and blacksmithing.
- **Powder**: For gunpowder, medicine, or filtration.
- **Briquettes**: Compressed dust with binders (modern).

### Possible substitutes

- **Coal**: Fossil fuel, burns hotter but contains impurities (sulfur) bad for steel.
- **Wood**: Readily available but burns cooler and smokier.
- **Coke**: Processed coal, used in modern blast furnaces.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: Absorbs water easily, making it hard to light.
- **Crushing**: Easily crushed into dust during transport.
- **Ash**: Leaves residue that must be cleared from forges.

### Risks and safety

- **Carbon Monoxide**: Burning charcoal produces deadly CO gas; ensure ventilation.
- **Fire Hazard**: Spontaneous combustion can occur if fresh charcoal is not properly cooled and aired.
- **Dust**: Inhalation can damage lungs over time.
