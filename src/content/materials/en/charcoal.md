Charcoal is a carbon-rich fuel made from wood or plant matter heated without enough oxygen to allow full combustion. It burns hotter and cleaner than raw wood.

## Description of what it is like

Charcoal is black, lightweight, and brittle. It leaves a dark powder when handled and produces a steady, intense heat with less flame and smoke than wood.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Made wherever wood can be heated in a covered pit, kiln, or mound.
- Signs: Black, porous chunks with a woody texture and low weight.
- It is a manufactured material.

### Minimum processing required

- Collect dry wood.
- Heat it in a low-oxygen enclosure until it turns black and lightweight.
- Cool it without exposing to open air to prevent it from burning to ash.

### Tools needed to work on it

- A covered pit, earthen kiln, or sealed container.
- Fire source to heat the wood.
- Shovel or tongs for handling hot material.

### Common forms of use

- Lump charcoal: For cooking and heating.
- Pulverized charcoal: For inks, pigments, or filtration.
- Briquettes: Mixed with binders for uniform fuel.

### Possible substitutes

- Wood: More available but less energy-dense.
- Coal: Hotter but smoky and often harder to obtain.
- Dried dung: Useful in treeless regions but lower heat.

### Limitations and common failures

- Moisture absorption: Loses efficiency if stored damp.
- Brittleness: Crumbles easily during transport.
- Over-carbonization: Can turn to ash if oxygen is not controlled.

### Risks and safety

- Carbon monoxide: Produces toxic gas in enclosed spaces.
- Fire hazard: Sparks and embers can start wildfires.
- Dust: Fine charcoal dust can irritate lungs.

### Related materials

- Wood: Primary source material.
- Ash: Residue after full combustion.
- Coal: Mineral fuel with higher density.
