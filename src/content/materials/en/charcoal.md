Charcoal is a lightweight black carbon residue produced by strongly heating wood (or other animal and plant materials) in minimal oxygen to remove all water and volatile constituents.

## Description of what it is like

Charcoal is black, brittle, and lightweight. It soils the hands when touched and burns with high heat and little smoke compared to wood.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: It is manufactured wherever wood or organic material and a controlled heat source are available.
- Signs: It does not occur naturally in large quantities (except after forest fires).
- It is a synthetic/processed material.

### Minimum processing required

- Preparation: Cutting wood into uniform pieces.
- Pyrolysis: Heating in a pit, mound, or kiln with limited air.
- Cooling: Allowing it to cool completely before exposure to air to prevent combustion.
- Sifting: Removing ash and uncharred wood.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Charcoal kilns or earth pits.
- Shovels and rakes.
- Sacks for storage.

### Common forms of use

- Lump charcoal: For fuel.
- Powdered: For filtering or medicinal use.
- Activated charcoal: Processed to have even higher porosity.

### Possible substitutes

- Coal: A natural mineral fuel.
- Wood: Though it burns less efficiently and with more smoke.
- Coke: Derived from coal, used in heavy metallurgy.

### Limitations and common failures

- Fragility: Easily crushed into unusable dust.
- Moisture: Less effective if it becomes damp.
- Spontaneous Combustion: If stored improperly while still hot.

### Risks and safety

- Carbon Monoxide: Burning charcoal in enclosed spaces is deadly.
- Fire hazard: Hot embers can stay active for a long time.
- Respiratory: Inhaling charcoal dust.

### Related materials

- Wood: The primary raw material.
- Carbon: The primary element in charcoal.
- Ash: The byproduct of burning charcoal.
