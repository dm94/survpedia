Alcohol (specifically Ethanol) is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is a psychoactive substance and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.

## Description of what it is like

A clear, colorless liquid that evaporates quickly at room temperature. It burns with a blue, smokeless flame.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Not found in pure form in nature. Found in small amounts in overripe, fermenting fruit.
- **Signs**: Smell of fermentation.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)**: Yeast converts sugars into ethanol and CO2. This yields up to ~15% alcohol.
- **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)**: Heating the fermented liquid to separate alcohol (lower boiling point) from water. This yields higher concentrations (up to 95%).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Fermentation Vessel**: Airlocked container.
- **[Still (Alembic)](/en/inventions/alembic)**: For distillation (Pot, condenser, collection vessel).
- **Thermometer**: To monitor distillation temperatures.

### Common forms of use

- **Beverage**: Beer, wine, spirits.
- **Medical**: Antiseptic for cleaning wounds and instruments (70% concentration is best).
- **Fuel**: **[Biofuel](/en/materials/biofuel)** (bioethanol) for lamps, stoves, or engines.
- **Solvent**: Dissolving resins, oils, and tinctures.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**: For cleaning (less effective disinfectant).
- **Oil**: For fuel (lamps).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Evaporation**: Must be stored in sealed containers.
- **Water Absorption**: Pure alcohol absorbs moisture from the air (hygroscopic).
- **Yeast Limits**: Yeast dies at around 15% alcohol, stopping fermentation.

### Risks and safety

- **Flammability**: Highly flammable vapor and liquid.
- **Toxicity**: Methanol (wood alcohol) can be produced if distilling wood/pectin-rich sources improperly, causing blindness or death.
- **Health**: Consumption can lead to addiction and organ damage.

### Related materials

- **Sugar**: Raw material for fermentation.
- **Yeast**: The agent of fermentation.
- **Vinegar**: Produced if alcohol is exposed to acetobacter and oxygen.
