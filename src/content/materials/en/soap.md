Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used primarily for washing, bathing, and cleaning. It works as a surfactant, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. It is a fundamental technology for hygiene and disease prevention.

## Description of what it is like

Solid soap usually comes in bars or cakes. It is slippery when wet and produces foam or lather when agitated with water. It has a characteristic clean smell, though it can be rancid if made with poor quality fats without added fragrances.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Man-made in settlements or camps. Some plants (saponins) can act as natural substitutes.
- **Signs**: Not found in nature.
- **Natural/Synthetic**: Synthetic (chemically processed).

### Minimum processing required

- **Lye Production**: Leaching wood ash with water to create a strong alkaline solution.
- **Fat Preparation**: Rendering animal fat or extracting vegetable oil.
- **Saponification**: Heating the fat and lye together until they thicken and react completely.
- **Curing**: Allowing the soap to dry and the reaction to complete (reducing causticity) over several weeks.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Non-reactive pot**: Stainless steel, ceramic, or glass (avoid aluminum as lye reacts with it).
- **Stirring stick/spoon**: Wooden or stainless steel.
- **Molds**: Wooden boxes or containers to shape the soap while it cools.
- **Protective gear**: Gloves and eye protection (lye is dangerous).

### Common forms of use

- **Hard Soap**: Sodium-based (using soda ash/salt), good for bars.
- **Soft Soap**: Potassium-based (using wood ash lye), often liquid or gel-like.
- **Insecticidal Soap**: Used to control soft-bodied pests on plants.

### Possible substitutes

- **Saponin-rich plants**: Soapwort, yucca root, soapberries.
- **Ash**: Can be used directly for cleaning greasy items (abrasive and alkaline).
- **Sand/Clay**: Mechanical cleaning via abrasion.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Lye Heavy**: Too much lye makes the soap caustic and irritating to skin.
- **Superfat**: Too much fat makes the soap soft, greasy, and prone to rancidity.
- **Hard Water**: Reacts with minerals in hard water to form "soap scum," reducing effectiveness.

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical Burns**: Raw lye and fresh soap can cause severe burns to skin and eyes.
- **Fumes**: Mixing lye produces fumes that should not be inhaled.
