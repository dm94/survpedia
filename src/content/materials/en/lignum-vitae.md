# Brief description

Lignum Vitae ("Wood of Life") is one of the hardest and densest woods in the world. It is famous for its natural oils (guaiac gum) which make it self-lubricating and incredibly resistant to water and rot.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Very dark brown to black heartwood, often with greenish streaks. The sapwood is yellow.
- **Texture:** Extremely fine grain, oily to the touch.
- **Weight:** So dense it sinks in water (Specific Gravity ~1.3).
- **Hardness:** Difficult to work with hand tools; dulls blades quickly.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Source:** The *Guaiacum* tree, native to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America.
- **Availability:** Endangered in the wild (CITES listed). Alternatives include Verawood (Argentine Lignum Vitae) or synthetic composites.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Harvesting:** Cutting the tree.
2.  **Seasoning:** Very slow drying is critical to prevent checking (cracking).
3.  **Turning:** Machining on a lathe to precise dimensions (for bearings).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Carbide Tools:** High-speed steel dulls rapidly.
- **Metalworking Lathe:** Often treated more like metal than wood due to its hardness.

### Common forms of use

- **Bearings:** The most famous use. Used for ship propeller shaft bearings (stern tubes) because the seawater cools it and the natural oil lubricates it.
- **Mallets:** For woodcarving and metalworking (doesn't mar the work but is heavy).
- **Pulleys (Sheaves):** In block and tackle systems on ships.

### Possible substitutes

- **Bronze:** For bearings, but requires external lubrication.
- **Plastic (Nylon/Teflon):** Modern self-lubricating plastics.
- **Verawood:** A related, similar wood.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Checking:** Prone to surface cracks if dried too fast.
- **Gluing:** Very difficult to glue due to the high oil content (must be wiped with solvent first).

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** The dust can cause skin irritation and respiratory issues for some people.
