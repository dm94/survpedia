Ceramics are inorganic, non-metallic materials made by shaping clay or mineral powders and firing them at high temperature. They range from porous earthenware to dense porcelain.

## Description of what it is like

Ceramics are hard and rigid with a smooth or matte surface. They resist heat and chemicals but can crack or shatter under impact.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Source materials:** **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** and other mineral powders.
- **Signs:** Produced in kilns or fired pits, not found in nature.
- **Synthetic:** Requires transformation by heat.

### Minimum processing required

- **Preparation:** Remove stones and organic matter from clay, then knead with water.
- **Shaping:** Form vessels, tiles, or parts by hand or on a [potter's wheel](/en/inventions/potters-wheel).
- **Drying:** Air-dry completely to avoid steam cracks.
- **Firing:** Heat in a kiln to harden the body.
- **Glazing (optional):** Apply a glassy coating for waterproofing.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mixing tools:** Paddles, troughs, or hands.
- **Shaping tools:** Molds, ribs, and cutting wires.
- **Drying racks:** Shelves with airflow.
- **Kiln:** Controlled high-temperature firing.

### Common forms of use

- **Earthenware:** Low-fire, porous, common for **[Pottery](/en/inventions/pottery)**.
- **Stoneware:** Denser and more water-resistant.
- **Porcelain:** High-fire, fine and translucent.
- **Glazed ceramics:** Waterproof containers and tiles.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Easy to work but not heat resistant.
- **[Iron](/en/materials/iron):** Strong and conductive, reacts with some foods.
- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass):** Heat resistant but more fragile to impact.
- **[Stone](/en/materials/stone):** Durable but harder to shape.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness:** Cracks and shatters under impact.
- **Thermal shock:** Rapid temperature changes cause fractures.
- **Porosity:** Low-fired bodies leak unless glazed.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns:** Hot ceramics retain heat for a long time.
- **Silica dust:** Grinding or sanding releases fine dust.
- **Kiln hazards:** High heat and fumes require ventilation.
