A welding electrode is a metal wire or rod, often coated with flux, used to conduct current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. In Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), the electrode is consumable, meaning it melts to become the filler metal for the weld.

## Description of what it is like

It typically consists of a straight metal core wire covered in a thick layer of hard, dry flux coating. The core wire conducts the electricity to the arc and provides filler metal. The flux coating burns to create a shielding gas and slag that protects the hot weld metal from oxidation.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Manufactured**: Must be created.
- **Scavenged**: Can be found in industrial supplies, workshops, or farms.

### Minimum processing required

- **Core Wire**: A straight piece of steel wire (e.g., from a coat hanger or fence wire) can serve as the core.
- **Flux Coating**: A mixture of flux materials (lime, silica, cellulose) and a binder (sodium silicate or wood glue) is applied to the wire and allowed to dry.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Wire Cutters**: To cut the core wire to length.
- **Mixing Bowl**: To mix the flux paste.
- **Dipping Tube**: A narrow tube to hold the flux paste for dipping the wire.
- **Drying Rack**: To hang the coated electrodes while they dry.

### Common forms of use

- **Stick Electrode**: The standard form for arc welding.
- **Bare Wire**: Used in gas welding or with separate flux (less common for arc welding without shielding gas).

### Possible substitutes

- **Bare Wire + Flux Paste**: If a coated electrode cannot be made, one can dip a bare wire into flux paste frequently, though the arc stability will be poor.
- **Carbon Rod**: From old batteries (for carbon arc welding/gouging, not adding filler).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Damp Flux**: If the coating absorbs moisture, it causes steam in the arc, leading to porosity (holes) in the weld and a difficult arc to start.
- **Cracked Coating**: If the flux falls off, the arc will be unstable and the weld will oxidize.
- **Wrong Core**: Using a high-carbon steel wire for low-carbon steel welding can cause cracking.

### Risks and safety

- **Fumes**: The burning flux produces smoke that can be harmful if inhaled.
- **Burns**: The electrode gets extremely hot during use.
- **Shock**: The electrode is electrically live when the welder is on.
