Antler is the bony outgrowth found on the heads of deer, elk, moose, and caribou. Unlike **[Horn](/en/materials/horn)**, which is permanent keratin, antler is solid bone that is grown and shed annually.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Branching bony structure. Fresh antlers are covered in "velvet" (skin), but the usable material is the hard, calcified bone revealed after the velvet is rubbed off.
- **Texture:** Rough on the outside, solid and dense on the inside (sometimes with a spongy core).
- **Properties:** It is tougher and more elastic than regular skeletal **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**, making it less likely to shatter under impact.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Source:** Cervids (Deer family).
- **Location:** Found on the forest floor in late winter/early spring after shedding.
- **Recognition:** Look for the characteristic branching shape.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection:** Finding shed antlers (ethical and sustainable) or harvesting from hunted animals.
2.  **Seasoning:** Fresh antler should dry for a few months to harden fully, but not too long or it becomes brittle and chalky.
3.  **Cutting:** Use a **[Saw](/en/inventions/saw)** (hacksaw works best) to cut into sections.
4.  **Soaking:** Soaking in water for a few days can soften it slightly for easier working/straightening.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Saw:** To cut the hard material.
- **Files/Rasps:** To shape the surface.
- **Sandpaper:** To smooth and polish.
- **Drill:** To make holes (burns easily if drilled too fast).

### Common forms of use

- **Tines (Points):** Used as pressure flakers for making **[Stone Tools](/en/inventions/stone-tools)** (flintknapping).
- **Beam (Main shaft):** Cut into sections for knife handles, hammer heads, or billets.
- **Carving:** Excellent for detailed carving of buttons, beads, or decorative items.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Bone](/en/materials/bone):** More brittle.
- **[Horn](/en/materials/horn):** Softer and can be delaminated.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Softer and less durable.
- **Hard Plastic:** Modern substitute.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Pith:** The center can be spongy (pithy), which is weak. Use the solid outer wall for strength.
- **Weathering:** Antlers left in the woods for too long turn white, chalky, and brittle (gnawed by rodents for calcium).
- **Smell:** Smells like burning hair/bone when cut or sanded violently.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** Breathing bone dust is harmful. Wear a mask.
- **Points:** Tines can be very sharp.

- **Ivory:** Denser dental material.
