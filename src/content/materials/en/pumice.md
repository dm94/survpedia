Pumice is a light, porous volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass. It is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a volcano.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Light colored (white, cream, grey) rock full of tiny holes (vesicles).
- **Texture:** Rough, scratchy, and sponge-like.
- **Properties:** Extremely lightweight; dry pumice will float on water. It is abrasive but friable (crumbles under pressure).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Occurrence:** Volcanic regions.
- **Location:** Near stratovolcanoes or washing up on beaches after ocean eruptions.
- **Recognition:** It looks like a hard sponge and floats.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection:** Gathering loose stones.
2.  **Washing:** Rinsing off salt or dirt.
3.  **Crushing:** Pounding into powder if used as a fine abrasive.
4.  **Shaping:** Can be rubbed against harder stones to shape into blocks.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hammer:** To crush it.
- **Mortar and Pestle:** To grind it into fine powder.

### Common forms of use

- **Solid Block:** Used to scrub skin (calluses) or scour cookware.
- **Powder:** Used as a polishing agent for **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**, metal, wood, or **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**.
- **Aggregate:** Mixed with **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)** to make lightweight concrete (used by Romans in the Pantheon dome).

### Possible substitutes

- **[Sand](/en/materials/sand):** Coarser abrasive.
- **Sandstone:** Harder abrasive block.
- **Ash:** For cleaning.
- **Steel Wool:** Modern abrasive.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Crushing:** It is not structural on its own; it crushes easily.
- **Absorption:** Absorbs water eventually and will sink.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** Breathing volcanic glass dust is bad for lungs.
- **Abrasion:** Can scratch softer materials unintentionally.

### Related materials

- **[Obsidian](/en/materials/obsidian):** Volcanic glass without the bubbles.
- **[Ash](/en/materials/ash):** Fine volcanic particles.
- **Scoria:** A darker, heavier, denser volcanic rock (sinks).
