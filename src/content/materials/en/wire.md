A single flexible strand or rod of metal. Wire is used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals.

## Description of what it is like

A long, thin, flexible metal cylinder. It can be bent easily without breaking (ductile) and has high tensile strength.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Artificial:** Manufactured from metals.
- **History:** Early wire was made by beating metal into sheets and cutting strips. Modern wire drawing dates back to the medieval period.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Casting:** Metal is cast into an ingot or billet.
2.  **Rolling:** Rolled into a rod.
3.  **Drawing:** Pulled through a series of dies (holes) made of hard material (tungsten carbide or diamond). Each die is slightly smaller than the wire, reducing its diameter and increasing its length.
4.  **Annealing:** Heating the wire to soften it if it becomes too brittle during drawing.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pliers:** For bending and cutting.
- **Draw Plate:** A plate with holes for manual drawing (primitive).
- **Hammer/Anvil:** For flattening or shaping ends.

### Common forms of use

- **Solid:** Single strand (stiff).
- **Stranded:** Multiple thin wires twisted together (more flexible, used in cables).
- **Coiled:** Springs.
- **Mesh:** Woven wire (fences, screens).

### Possible substitutes

- **[Rope](/en/materials/rope):** For mechanical tying/binding (weaker, rot risk).
- **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers):** Primitive binding.
- **Leather Strips:** For binding.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Fatigue:** Repeated bending will cause it to snap (work hardening).
- **Corrosion:** Rusts if not galvanized or coated.
- **Overheating:** If used for electricity, can melt if current is too high.

### Risks and safety

- **Cuts:** Ends are sharp.
- **Whiplash:** Under tension, a snapping wire can cause severe injury.
- **Shock:** Conducts electricity.
