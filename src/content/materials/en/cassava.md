Cassava is a hardy root crop that thrives in poor soils and dry conditions. It is highly starchy but needs careful processing to be safe.

## Description of what it is like

Thick, brown-skinned roots with white or yellow flesh. Fresh cassava is firm and watery, but it becomes floury when dried.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Tropical and subtropical fields, often in low-fertility soils.
- Signs: Shrubby plants with palmate leaves and thick underground roots.
- It is a cultivated crop grown from stem cuttings.

### Minimum processing required

- Peeling: Remove the outer skin.
- Grating: Break the root into small pieces.
- Soaking or fermentation: Reduce toxic compounds.
- Drying: Make flour or shelf-stable granules.
- Cooking: Heat thoroughly before eating.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Cutting tools for harvest and peeling.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** for pounding.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for soaking and storage.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for cooking and drying.

### Common forms of use

- Cassava flour for flatbreads.
- Thick porridges and stews.
- Tapioca pearls or starch.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Potato](/en/materials/potato)** as another starchy tuber.
- **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)** or **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)** as grains.
- **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** for flour-based foods.

### Limitations and common failures

- Short shelf life when fresh.
- Detox step: Skipping soaking or fermentation is dangerous.
- Low protein content: Needs complementary foods.

### Risks and safety

- Cyanide poisoning: Improperly processed cassava can be fatal.
- Spoilage: Fermentation must be controlled to avoid rot.
