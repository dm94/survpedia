Ash is the powdery residue left after the combustion of a substance. Wood ash is of particular importance in a survival context as a source of potash (potassium carbonate) and lye.

## Description of what it is like

It is a gray or white powder, soft to the touch, and very light. It is alkaline (basic) and can cause skin irritation if wet (forming lye).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Any place where fire has consumed organic matter (hearths, forest fire sites).
- **Signs**: Piles of gray/white powder at the base of a fire.
- **Natural/Synthetic**: It is a byproduct of combustion.

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection**: Gathering the cold ash from the fire pit.
- **Sifting**: Removing unburnt charcoal and debris.
- **Leaching (for Lye)**: Running water through the ash to extract soluble salts (potash/lye).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Shovel or scoop**: For collection.
- **Sieve/Mesh**: For cleaning.
- **Containers**: For storage (must be kept dry).

### Common forms of use

- **Dry Powder**: Applied to soil as fertilizer or used as a mild abrasive for cleaning.
- **Lye (Liquid)**: Extracted with water for soap making.
- **Paste**: Mixed with water for **[tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning)** hides or cleaning.

### Possible substitutes

- **Lime (Calcium Oxide)**: For alkaline applications (mortar, **[tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning)**).
- **Soda Ash**: Found in some mineral deposits or burnt seaweed.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: Ash becomes useless (or turns to lye unintentionally) if it gets wet during storage.
- **Incomplete Combustion**: Mixing with too much charcoal reduces quality for some uses.

### Risks and safety

- **Caustic**: Wet ash (lye) causes chemical burns.
- **Inhalation**: Breathing ash dust is harmful to the lungs.
- **Hot Embers**: Fresh ash may contain hidden hot coals that can start fires.

### Related materials

- **Wood**: The most common source.
- **Charcoal**: Often found mixed with ash.
- **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**: Made using lye derived from ash.
- **Glass**: Some types of glass use ash as a flux.
