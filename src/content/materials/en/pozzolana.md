Pozzolana is a siliceous or aluminosiliceous material that, by itself, possesses little or no cementitious value, but which, in finely divided form and in the presence of moisture, chemically reacts with calcium hydroxide (**[Lime](/en/materials/lime)**) at ordinary temperatures to form compounds with cementitious properties.

## Description of what it is like

- **Natural:** Porous powder or rock of varied colors (gray, red, black), typical of volcanic areas.
- **Artificial:** Reddish powder coming from crushed bricks or tiles.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural:** Volcanic ash deposits (famous in Pozzuoli, Italy).
- **Artificial:** **[Pottery](/en/inventions/pottery)**, **[Bricks](/en/materials/brick)**, or tiles crushed into a fine powder.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection/Crushing:** Obtain volcanic ash or crush ceramic waste.
2.  **Grinding:** Must be a very fine powder to react well with lime.
3.  **Sieving:** Remove large pieces.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mill/Mortar:** To pulverize ceramics or volcanic rock.
- **Sieve:** To ensure the fineness of the powder.

### Common forms of use

- **[Primitive Cement](/en/materials/primitive-cement):** Mixed with **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)** and water. This creates a hydraulic cement that can set underwater, crucial for ports, cisterns, and bridges.
- **Mortar additive:** Improves the strength and durability of standard lime mortar.

### Possible substitutes

- **Coal fly ash:** In modern times.
- **Calcined clay:** Clay fired at specific temperatures and then ground.
- **Diatomaceous earth:** Another source of reactive silica.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture:** Must be kept dry before mixing.
- **Proportion:** Requires adequate proportion with lime (typically 2:1 or 3:1 pozzolana:lime) to be effective.

### Risks and safety

- **Silicosis:** Inhalation of fine silica dust is dangerous in the long term. Use respiratory protection (wet cloth/mask).
