Fiberglass is a material consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass. It is used as an insulating material and as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products (glass-reinforced plastic).

## Description of what it is like

It appears as a pink, yellow, or white fluffy wool (insulation) or as woven mats and fabrics (reinforcement). It is lightweight but can be irritating to the skin.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic**: Manufactured in industrial facilities.
- **Source**: Made from silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and recycled glass.

### Minimum processing required

- **Melting**: Raw materials are melted at high temperatures (~1400°C).
- **Extrusion/Spinning**: Molten glass is spun into fibers.
- **Binding**: Fibers are coated with chemical binders to hold them together in batts or mats.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Utility Knife**: To cut insulation batts.
- **Scissors/Shears**: To cut fiberglass cloth.
- **Resin application tools**: Brushes and rollers (for GRP).
- **PPE**: Gloves, goggles, and respirators are mandatory.

### Common forms of use

- **Batts/Rolls**: Fluffy insulation placed between wall studs.
- **Loose-fill**: Blown into attics.
- **Composites**: Layered with epoxy or polyester resin to make strong, light structures (boats, tanks).

### Possible substitutes

- **Mineral Wool**: Stone wool, similar properties but higher melting point.
- **Cellulose**: Recycled paper insulation (flammable if not treated).
- **Natural Fibers**: Wool, hemp (less irritating, eco-friendly).
- **Carbon Fiber**: Stronger and lighter for reinforcement, but much more expensive.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Compression**: Loses insulating value if compressed.
- **Moisture**: Can absorb water if not treated, reducing insulation.
- **UV Degradation**: Resin in composites can degrade in sunlight if not painted.

### Risks and safety

- **Irritation**: Fibers cause severe skin, eye, and throat irritation. "Fiberglass itch".
- **Inhalation**: Fine dust can damage lungs. Always wear a mask.
- **Formaldehyde**: Some binders release formaldehyde gas.
