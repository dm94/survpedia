Mercury, also known as quicksilver, is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. It is a heavy, silvery-white metal with a fascinating but dangerous history.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** A heavy, silvery-white liquid. It has high surface tension, forming spherical beads that roll easily.
- **Texture:** Liquid, cold to the touch (high thermal conductivity), and extremely dense (13.5 times heavier than water).
- **Behavior:** It does not wet glass or most surfaces but amalgamates (dissolves) with many metals like gold, silver, and tin.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Found in deposits worldwide, mostly as cinnabar (mercury sulfide). Rare as native metal.
- **Signs:** Cinnabar is a bright red to brick-red mineral.
- **Natural:** Occurs naturally but usually requires extraction from ore.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mining:** Extract cinnabar ore.
2.  **Roasting:** Heat the ore in a furnace or retort to about 600°C. The sulfur combines with oxygen to form SO2, and the mercury vaporizes.
3.  **Condensation:** Pass the vapor through cooled tubes to condense it back into liquid metal.
4.  **Purification:** Filter through leather or wash with nitric acid to remove impurities.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Retort/Distillation Apparatus:** To capture and condense vapors safely.
- **Glass or Iron Containers:** For storage (it amalgamates with other metals).
- **Ventilation:** Critical due to toxic vapors.

### Common forms of use

- **Liquid Metal:** In thermometers, barometers, and tilt switches.
- **Amalgams:** Alloys with silver, tin, or gold. Used in dental fillings and for making antique **[mirrors](/en/inventions/mirror)** (tin-mercury amalgam).
- **Vapor:** In fluorescent lamps and mercury-vapor streetlights.

### Possible substitutes

- **Alcohol/Galinstan:** Non-toxic alternatives for thermometers.
- **Silver/Aluminum:** For mirrors (vacuum deposition).
- **Cyanide:** Alternative for gold extraction (also toxic).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Freezing:** Solidifies at -38.8°C.
- **Vaporization:** Evaporates slowly at room temperature, releasing invisible toxic gas.
- **Amalgamation:** Destroys aluminum structures (e.g., aircraft) by embrittlement.

### Risks and safety

- **Neurotoxin:** Inhaling vapors or ingesting compounds causes severe neurological damage (Mad Hatter disease).
- **Accumulation:** Bioaccumulates in the food chain.
- **Spills:** Very difficult to clean; spreads into tiny beads. Use sulfur powder to bind it.
