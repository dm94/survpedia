Cotton and yarn cover the material chain from raw cotton fiber to the spun strands used for textiles and stitching.

## Description of what it is like

Raw cotton is soft, light, and fluffy. When spun, the fibers become a continuous strand with tensile strength while keeping flexibility and a soft hand.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Tropical and subtropical fields where cotton is cultivated.
- **Signs**: Cotton bolls bursting with white fiber, plus spinning tools and skeins of yarn in settlements.
- **Natural**: Cotton is natural; yarn is a transformed product.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Pick cotton bolls.
- **Ginning**: Remove seeds from fiber.
- **Carding/Combing**: Clean and align fibers.
- **Spinning**: Twist fibers into yarn.
- **If skipped**: Uncleaned or unaligned fiber spins unevenly and breaks easily.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hands**: For harvesting and basic seed removal.
- **Cotton Gin**: To speed up seed separation.
- **Carders/Combs**: For fiber alignment.
- **Spindle or Spinning Wheel**: For spinning yarn.
- **Loom or Needles**: For weaving or sewing.

### Common forms of use

- **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**: Raw fiber for padding or spinning.
- **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)**: Spun strands for weaving and sewing.
- **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**: Woven cotton cloth for garments and household use.
- **Cordage**: Twisted yarn for light ropes or ties.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Linen](/en/materials/linen)**: Stronger and crisper but less elastic.
- **[Wool](/en/materials/wool)**: Warmer and more elastic, less breathable.
- **Other plant fibers**: Hemp or nettle fiber for sturdier but rougher yarn.
- **Synthetic fibers**: Polyester or rayon (modern).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: Cotton absorbs water and dries slowly.
- **Rot/Mildew**: Damp storage leads to decay.
- **Weak spots**: Uneven spinning causes breakage under tension.
- **Flammability**: Burns readily unless treated.

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Lint and fibers are highly flammable.
- **Dust**: Fine cotton dust can irritate lungs over time.
- **Cuts**: Tight yarn under tension can cut skin.
