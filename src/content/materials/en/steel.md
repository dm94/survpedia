Steel is an alloy primarily composed of iron and a small percentage of carbon (usually between 0.02% and 2.1% by weight). It is the world's most important engineering and construction material.

## How Steel is Made

The modern steelmaking process can be broken down into several key stages:

### 1. Ironmaking
The first step is to produce iron from iron ore. This is typically done in a **Blast Furnace**.
- **Inputs**: Iron ore, coke (fuel derived from coal), and limestone.
- **Process**: These materials are layered into the furnace while hot air is blasted in. The coke acts as a reducing agent, stripping oxygen from the iron ore.
- **Output**: Molten iron, also known as "pig iron," which still contains a high amount of carbon (about 4%).

### 2. Primary Steelmaking
In this stage, the pig iron is refined into steel by reducing its carbon content. There are two main methods:
- **Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS)**: High-purity oxygen is blown through the molten iron, oxidizing the excess carbon and other impurities.
- **Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)**: This method uses high-power electric arcs to melt recycled steel scrap or direct-reduced iron. It is more flexible and environmentally friendly than the BOS method.

### 3. Secondary Steelmaking
The molten steel is further refined to achieve the exact chemical composition required. This involves:
- Removing dissolved gases (like oxygen and nitrogen).
- Adding alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, or nickel to enhance properties like strength or corrosion resistance.

### 4. Continuous Casting
The molten steel is cast into solid shapes like billets, blooms, or slabs. Modern facilities use continuous casting, where the steel is poured into a water-cooled mold and emerges as a continuous strand.

### 5. Forming and Finishing
Finally, the steel is shaped into its final form (sheets, bars, beams) through various processes:
- **Hot Rolling**: Rolling the steel at high temperatures to achieve the desired thickness.
- **Cold Rolling**: Further thinning and strengthening the steel at room temperature.
- **Coating**: Applying protective layers (like zinc for galvanization) to prevent rust.

## Importance

Used in everything from skyscrapers and infrastructure to tools and vehicles. Its strength-to-weight ratio and durability made it a cornerstone of modern civilization.
