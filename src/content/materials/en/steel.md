Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, and sometimes other elements. Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.

## Description of what it is like

Steel is a grey, metallic material. It is harder and stronger than pure iron but remains flexible enough to resist breaking under tension. It can be polished to a high shine.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Does not occur naturally. It must be manufactured from iron.
- Signs: Found in industrial settings or as reclaimed scrap from older structures.
- It is a synthetic alloy.

### Minimum processing required

- Refining: Removing excess carbon and impurities (like silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur) from molten pig iron.
- Alloying: Adding precise amounts of carbon (usually between 0.02% and 2.1% by weight).
- Heat Treatment: Quenching (rapid cooling) and tempering (reheating) to achieve desired hardness and toughness.

### Tools needed to work on it

- High-temperature furnaces (Bessemer converter, electric arc furnace).
- Forges and anvils for manual shaping.
- Power hammers and rolling mills for industrial shaping.
- Cutting tools made of even harder materials (like tungsten carbide).

### Common forms of use

- Carbon Steel: Used for most structural and mechanical applications.
- Stainless Steel: Contains chromium to resist corrosion, used in cutlery and medical tools.
- Tool Steel: Especially hard alloys used for making cutting and drilling tools.

### Possible substitutes

- Iron: Cheaper and easier to produce but much weaker and softer.
- Aluminum: Lighter and more corrosion-resistant, but generally less strong.
- Titanium: Stronger and lighter than steel but much more expensive and difficult to work.

### Limitations and common failures

- Corrosion (Rust): Like iron, most steel will rust if exposed to moisture and oxygen.
- Fatigue: Can develop cracks after many cycles of stress.
- Brittleness: If too much carbon is added or if heat treatment is incorrect, it can shatter.

### Risks and safety

- Heat Hazards: Molten steel and hot metal cause extreme burns.
- Sharp Edges: Machined or broken steel can be razor-sharp.
- Heavy Loads: Large steel components are dangerous if dropped.

### Related materials

- Iron: The primary component of steel.
- Charcoal/Coal: Sources of carbon and heat for production.
- Bronze: A historical predecessor for strong tools and weapons.
