Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, and sometimes other elements. Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, machines, electrical appliances, and weapons.

## Description of what it is like

Steel is a hard, strong, greyish metal. It can be polished to a high shine. Unlike pure iron, it is much harder and holds a sharp edge better, making it ideal for cutting tools.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Not found in nature**: Steel is a man-made alloy.
- **Requires processing**: It is created by refining iron and adding a specific amount of carbon (usually between 0.002% and 2.1%).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Smelting**: Iron ore is smelted into pig iron.
2.  **Refining**: Impurities are removed, and carbon content is adjusted (Bessemmer process or modern basic oxygen steelmaking).
3.  **Heat Treatment**: Quenching and tempering to adjust hardness and toughness.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Forge/Furnace**: High temperatures are needed to work steel.
- **Anvil and Hammer**: For shaping.
- **Grindstone**: For sharpening and polishing.

### Common forms of use

- **Forged**: Shaped while hot.
- **Cast**: Poured into molds (less common for tools).
- **Machined**: Cut and shaped with other harder tools.

### Possible substitutes

- **Iron**: Softer, loses edge quickly.
- **Bronze**: Easier to cast, resistant to corrosion, but softer than good steel.
- **Titanium**: Modern, lighter, stronger, but much harder to process.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rust**: Unless stainless (alloyed with chromium), steel rusts easily in damp environments.
- **Brittleness**: High carbon steel can be brittle if not tempered correctly.

### Risks and safety

- **High Heat**: Working with molten or hot steel poses burn risks.
- **Sharp Edges**: Finished steel tools are very sharp.
