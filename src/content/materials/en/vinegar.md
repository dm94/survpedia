Vinegar is an aqueous solution of acetic acid and trace compounds that may include flavorings. It is typically 5-8% acetic acid by volume.

## Description of what it is like

A clear to amber liquid with a pungent, sour smell and taste.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Can occur naturally in spoiled alcoholic beverages (wine turning sour).
- **Signs**: Sour smell in old fruit juices or alcohol.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **[Alcoholic Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)**: Create a weak alcoholic solution (cider, wine, beer).
- **Acetic Fermentation**: Expose the alcohol to oxygen and _Acetobacter_ bacteria (Mother of Vinegar).
- **Aging**: Allow time for the conversion to complete (weeks to months).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Wide-mouthed Container**: To maximize oxygen exposure.
- **Breathable Cover**: Cheesecloth to keep bugs out but let air in.
- **Dark Place**: UV light can damage the bacteria.

### Common forms of use

- **Pickling**: Preserving vegetables in an acidic environment.
- **Culinary**: Salad dressings, sauces.
- **Cleaning**: Removing limescale, cleaning glass, neutralizing odors.
- **Tanning**: Deliming hides in **[Tanning](/en/inventions/tanning)**.

### Possible substitutes

- **Lemon Juice**: For acidity and flavor (citric acid).
- **Lactic Acid**: From fermented vegetables (sauerkraut).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Mother Required**: Often needs a starter culture ("Mother of Vinegar") to proceed efficiently.
- **Complete Conversion**: If not finished, it may still contain alcohol or not be acidic enough to preserve food safely.

### Risks and safety

- **Acidity**: Concentrated acetic acid can burn skin and eyes (though household vinegar is usually safe).
- **Metal Corrosion**: Acid reacts with metals; use glass, wood, or plastic.

### Related materials

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: The precursor to vinegar.
- **[Simple Acids](/en/materials/simple-acids)**: Concentrated version (Strong Vinegar).
- **Sugar**: The precursor to alcohol.
- **Water**: The solvent.
