Natural rubber is a resilient, elastic polymer harvested as latex from rubber trees. It can be used as-is for flexible coatings, or vulcanized to become tougher, more heat resistant, and less sticky.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Milky latex that dries into pale tan sheets or blocks.
- **Texture:** Stretchy and tacky when fresh; smooth and springy when cured.
- **Behavior:** Softens with heat, stiffens in cold, and rebounds after deformation.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Tropical forests and plantations where rubber trees grow.
- **Signs:** Milky latex bleeding from shallow bark cuts; coagulated clumps on tools.
- **Natural vs processed:** Latex is natural; sheets, blocks, and vulcanized rubber are processed forms.

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection:** Tap trees and collect latex in clean cups.
- **Coagulation:** Add mild acid, smoke, or allow natural coagulation.
- **Washing and drying:** Rinse and press into sheets; dry or smoke to stabilize.
- **Optional vulcanization:** Heat with sulfur to reduce stickiness and increase durability.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Tapping knife or sharp blade.
- Collection cups or troughs.
- Cloth strainers for debris.
- Rolling boards or molds.
- Drying rack or smokehouse.
- Heat source and sulfur for vulcanization.

### Common forms of use

- **Latex:** Coatings, simple adhesives, and waterproofing layers.
- **Dried sheets:** Cut into straps, pads, and flexible covers.
- **Vulcanized rubber:** Tires, soles, gaskets, and durable seals.
- **Rubberized fabric:** Waterproof clothing and gear.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Resin](/en/materials/resin):** Waterproofing and sealing, but brittle.
- **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax):** Flexible sealant, softens with heat.
- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather):** Straps and seals, less elastic.
- **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers):** Cords and belts, not waterproof.
- **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric):** Flexible base layers, lacks stretch and sealing.

### Limitations and common failures

- **UV and ozone cracking:** Sunlight and air exposure cause surface cracks.
- **Heat sensitivity:** Softens and deforms when overheated.
- **Cold stiffening:** Loses flexibility in low temperatures.
- **Oil swelling:** Oils and solvents can weaken and swell rubber.

### Risks and safety

- **Latex allergy:** Some people react to natural latex proteins.
- **Smoke and fumes:** Drying and vulcanization require ventilation.
- **Burns:** Hot rubber and heated molds can cause injuries.
