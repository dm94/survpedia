# Description of what it is like

Plastic refers to a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that use polymers as a main ingredient. They are typically lightweight, waterproof, and can be molded into almost any shape when soft, then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic:** Most plastics are derived from petrochemicals (oil, natural gas).
- **Natural analogs:** Rubber (latex), horn, shell, and tortoiseshell are natural polymers that behave similarly.
- **Scavenging:** In a post-collapse scenario, plastic is a non-renewable resource found in ruins, landfills, and oceans.

### Minimum processing required

- **Recycling:** Thermoplastics can be melted and remolded.
- **Cleaning:** Must be cleaned of contaminants before melting.
- **Sorting:** Different types (PET, HDPE) must be separated as they have different melting points and properties.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Heat Source:** Controlled heat (oven, hot plate) to soften without burning.
- **Molds:** Metal, wood, or silicone molds to shape the molten plastic.
- **Cutting:** Saws, knives for shaping solid plastic.
- **Ventilation:** Essential to avoid toxic fumes when melting.

### Common forms of use

- **Containers:** Bottles, buckets, waterproof storage.
- **Cordage:** Synthetic ropes (nylon, polypropylene) are stronger and rot-resistant compared to natural fibers.
- **Insulation:** Electrical wire coating, thermal insulation.
- **Parts:** Gears, handles, clips.

### Possible substitutes

- **Containers:** **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)**, **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**, metal, gourds.
- **Waterproofing:** Waxed fabric, tar, gut.
- **Moldable parts:** Horn, bone, wood.

### Limitations and common failures

- **UV Degradation:** Becomes brittle and cracks when exposed to sunlight over time.
- **Heat:** Melts or deforms at relatively low temperatures compared to metal or pottery.
- **Chemical Sensitivity:** Some solvents (acetone, gasoline) dissolve certain plastics.

### Risks and safety

- **Fumes:** Burning plastic releases toxic smoke (dioxins, furans). Always melt in a well-ventilated area.
- **Microplastics:** Break down into tiny particles that contaminate water and food.
- **Fire:** Highly flammable; once ignited, it is hard to extinguish and drips burning liquid.
