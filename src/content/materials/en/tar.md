Tar is a dark, thick, oily liquid produced by the destructive distillation of organic matter, such as wood or coal. Pine tar, specifically, has been used for centuries to preserve wood and rope.

## Description of what it is like

It is a black or dark brown viscous liquid with a strong, smoky, and distinctive smell. It feels sticky and oily. Unlike pitch, which is solid at room temperature, tar remains liquid or semi-fluid.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Production**: It must be manufactured; it does not occur naturally in this form.
- **Sources**: Resinous woods (pine stumps, roots), birch bark, or coal.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Preparation**: Dig up resin-rich pine stumps or gather birch bark. Cut into small splinters.
2.  **Packing**: Pack the wood tightly into a metal container (can) or an earthen pit with a hole in the bottom.
3.  **Heating**: Build a fire around the container (or on top of the pit) to heat the wood without burning it (pyrolysis).
4.  **Collection**: The heat forces the tar out of the wood; it drips through the bottom hole into a collector vessel.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Containers**: Two metal cans (one with holes in the bottom, one to catch the tar) or a pit setup.
- **Shovel**: For digging roots and the pit.
- **Fire**: To provide the heat for distillation.

### Common forms of use

- **Wood Preservative**: Painted onto siding, boats, and shingles to prevent rot (e.g., "skis").
- **Cordage Treatment**: Soaking natural fiber ropes in tar prevents them from rotting in water.
- **Soap**: Pine tar is added to soap for its antiseptic properties (treating eczema, psoriasis).
- **Adhesive**: When boiled down further to become Pitch, it becomes a strong hot-melt glue.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen)**: Similar waterproofing properties but from petroleum.
- **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**: Raw sap, stickier but less penetrating.
- **Linseed Oil/Tung Oil**: For wood preservation (less effective against rot than tar).
- **Creosote**: A toxic distillate of tar used for railroad ties.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Drying Time**: Tar takes a very long time to dry and soak in; it can remain tacky for weeks.
- **Staining**: It permanently stains clothing and skin.
- **Smell**: The strong odor can be overpowering and lingers for a long time.

### Risks and safety

- **Carcinogens**: Coal tar is known to be carcinogenic. Pine tar is generally safer but prolonged exposure should be minimized.
- **Flammability**: It is highly flammable.
- **Burns**: The distillation process involves high heat and hot liquids.

### Related materials

- **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**: The solid byproduct left in the container after extracting the tar.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: The source material.
- **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**: The raw component in the wood that becomes tar.
- **Pitch**: Tar that has been boiled down to a solid state.
