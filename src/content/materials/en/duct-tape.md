Duct tape is a durable, pressure-sensitive adhesive tape with a cloth backing and a polyethylene coating. It is known for its versatility, strength, and water resistance.

## Description of what it is like

It typically comes in silver or black rolls. It has three layers:

1.  **Top layer**: A thin film of polyethylene (plastic) that provides waterproofing.
2.  **Middle layer**: A fabric mesh (cotton scrim) that gives it tensile strength and allows it to be torn by hand.
3.  **Bottom layer**: A thick, rubber-based adhesive that sticks to almost anything.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Scavenging**: Hardware stores, workshops, garages, industrial sites, and homes.
- **Signs**: Look for rolls in toolboxes or supply closets.
- **It is a manufactured product.**

### Minimum processing required

- **None**: It is ready to use straight off the roll.
- **Cleaning surfaces**: For best adhesion, the surface should be clean and dry before applying.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hands**: It is designed to be torn by hand across the width.
- **Knife/Scissors**: For cleaner cuts or longitudinal strips.

### Common forms of use

- **Repairs**: Patching holes in tents, clothing, or containers.
- **Sealing**: Closing gaps in windows, doors, or ducts (originally for ammo cases, not air ducts!).
- **Binding**: Strapping items together, splinting broken bones (over padding).
- **Cordage**: Twisting it makes a strong rope.
- **Fire Starter**: It is flammable and can be used as tinder.

### Possible substitutes

- **Tarred Canvas**: Cloth impregnated with tar or pitch for waterproofing.
- **Birch Bark & Pitch**: Natural waterproof patches glued with resin.
- **Rawhide**: Wet rawhide shrinks as it dries, binding things tightly.
- **Electrical Tape**: Less strong, stretchier.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Heat**: The adhesive can melt and become messy in high heat.
- **Cold**: Adhesion fails in freezing temperatures.
- **UV Light**: The plastic backing degrades and cracks in sunlight over time.
- **Residue**: Leaves a sticky mess when removed.

### Risks and safety

- **Skin Irritation**: The adhesive can irritate skin if left on for long periods.
- **Circulation**: Do not wrap tightly around limbs as a tourniquet unless intended; it does not stretch and can cut off blood flow.
- **Flammability**: Burns vigorously with toxic smoke.
