Resin is a solid or highly viscous substance of plant or synthetic origin that is typically convertible into polymers. Natural resins are often mixtures of organic compounds.

## Description of what it is like

Natural resin is a sticky, thick liquid that hardens over time or when cooled. It is often translucent and ranges in color from clear to deep amber. When burned, it often produces a pleasant, aromatic smoke.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Forests, particularly those with pine, fir, or spruce trees.
- Signs: Sticky droplets or "tears" on tree bark; amber-colored lumps on the ground near trees.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Collection: Scraping from tree trunks.
- Purification: Heating and straining to remove bark, insects, and other debris.
- Hardening: Allowing it to cool or dry.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Knives or scrapers for collection.
- Containers for heating.
- Strainers (cloth or fine mesh).

### Common forms of use

- Raw: As a temporary adhesive or for starting fires.
- Purified: As a sealant for boats or containers.
- Rosin: Solid form used for friction-increasing applications.

### Possible substitutes

- Animal Glue: Made from boiled hides and bones (not waterproof).
- Pitch/Tar: Derived from wood or coal (more durable but darker).
- Beeswax: For sealing, though less permanent and heat-sensitive.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittleness: Can become very brittle and crack in cold temperatures.
- Heat Sensitivity: Will soften or melt if exposed to high heat.
- Aging: Can become dark and lose its adhesive properties over very long periods.

### Risks and safety

- Flammability: Highly flammable; must be handled carefully near open flames.
- Skin Irritation: Some people may experience allergic reactions or irritation from contact.

### Related materials

- Wood: The source of most natural resins.
- Charcoal: Often produced alongside resin when heating wood.
- Natural Rubber: Another type of plant exudate.
