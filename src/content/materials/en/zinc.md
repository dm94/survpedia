Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous metal. It is brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 °C and 150 °C. It is a moderately reactive metal that combines with oxygen and other non-metals, and reacts with dilute acids to release hydrogen.

## Description of what it is like

It has a silvery-grey appearance when oxidation is removed. It tarnishes in moist air to form a protective layer of basic zinc carbonate.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Zinc is rarely found in its native form. It is mostly found in ores, the most common being sphalerite (zinc sulfide).
- **Signs**: Sphalerite is often found in association with galena (lead ore), chalcopyrite (copper ore), and pyrite (iron sulfide).
- **Requires transformation**: It requires extraction from its ore.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Roasting**: The ore is roasted (heated in air) to convert zinc sulfide to zinc oxide.
2.  **Reduction**: The zinc oxide is then reduced with carbon (coal/charcoal) at high temperatures to produce zinc metal. The zinc boils off as a gas and is condensed.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Furnace**: Capable of reaching temperatures around 1000°C for reduction.
- **Retorts/Condensers**: To collect the zinc vapor.
- **Molds**: To cast the zinc into ingots.

### Common forms of use

- **Sheet**: Rolled zinc for roofing or battery cases (anodes).
- **Coating**: Dipping iron/steel in molten zinc (galvanization) to prevent rust.
- **Alloy**: Mixed with copper to make brass.

### Possible substitutes

- **Tin**: For coating steel (tinplate), though less effective as a sacrificial anode.
- **Magnesium/Aluminum**: As sacrificial anodes.
- **Plastic/Composite**: For non-structural corrosion resistance.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Zinc Pest**: At low temperatures, tin-zinc alloys can degrade.
- **Fumes**: Breathing zinc oxide fumes during melting/welding can cause "metal fume fever".
