# Brief description

**Sheet Metal** is metal formed by an industrial process into thin, flat pieces. It is one of the fundamental forms used in metalworking and can be cut and bent into a variety of shapes.

## Properties

- **Thickness (Gauge):** Can range from extremely thin foil to thick plate.
- **Formability:** Can be bent, curled, and drawn into complex shapes without breaking.
- **Strength:** Depends on the material and work hardening during rolling.
- **Surface Finish:** Can be smooth, polished, or textured.

## Uses

- **Construction:** **[Roofing](/en/inventions/roofing)**, gutters, siding, and flashing.
- **Transportation:** Car bodies, airplane wings, and train cars.
- **Containers:** Cans, barrels, and tanks.
- **Tools/Appliances:** Casings for machines and electronics.

## Manufacturing Process

1.  **Melting:** Metal is melted and cast into large rectangular ingots or slabs.
2.  **Hot Rolling:** The slab is heated and passed through a **[Rolling Mill](/en/inventions/rolling-mill)** multiple times to reduce thickness.
3.  **Pickling:** Acid bath removes scale and oxides.
4.  **Cold Rolling:** Further rolling at room temperature for precise thickness and smooth finish.
5.  **Annealing:** Heating to relieve internal stresses and restore ductility.

## Variants

- **Galvanized Steel:** Steel sheet coated with **[Zinc](/en/materials/zinc)** to prevent rust.
- **Tinplate:** Steel sheet coated with **[Tin](/en/materials/tin)** (used for food cans).
- **Corrugated Sheet:** Wavy pattern added for stiffness (roofing).
