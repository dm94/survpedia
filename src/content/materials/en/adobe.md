Adobe is a building material made from earth and organic materials. It is one of the earliest building materials and is still used worldwide.

## Description of what it is like

Adobe bricks are rectangular blocks of dried mud. They are typically larger than standard fired bricks. They have a rough, earthy texture and are usually brown or reddish, depending on the local soil color.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic:** It is a manufactured material, but the ingredients are ubiquitous.
- **Raw Materials:**
    - **Earth:** A mix of **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** (binder), **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** (aggregate), and silt.
    - **Fiber:** **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**, grass, or manure (provides tensile strength and prevents cracking).
    - **[Water](/en/materials/water):** To make the mix plastic.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Testing:** Test local soil. Too much clay cracks; too much sand crumbles.
2.  **Mixing:** Mix earth with water to a thick mud consistency. Add chopped straw.
3.  **Molding:** Press the mud into wooden frames (molds) on flat ground.
4.  **Drying:** Remove the mold immediately. Let bricks dry in the sun for several days/weeks. Turn them occasionally for even drying.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Shovels/Hoes:** For mixing.
- **Molds:** Wooden frames (ladders) for shaping bricks.
- **Feet:** Traditionally used for mixing large batches.

### Common forms of use

- **Bricks:** Sun-dried blocks laid with mud mortar.
- **Cob:** Sculpting walls directly with the mud mixture (no bricks).
- **Rammed Earth:** Compacting damp earth into formwork (similar material, different technique).
- **Plaster:** Mud plaster to protect walls.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Brick](/en/materials/brick):** Fired brick is stronger and water-resistant.
- **[Concrete Block](/en/materials/concrete-block):** Modern, stronger substitute.
- **Stone:** Natural alternative.
- **Wood:** For structural framing.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Water Sensitivity:** Adobe dissolves in rain. Walls must be protected by wide eaves (roof overhangs) and raised foundations.
- **Earthquakes:** Heavy and brittle; prone to collapse in earthquakes unless reinforced.
- **Insects:** Straw can attract termites if not properly sealed.

### Risks and safety

- **Collapse:** Heavy walls can cause injury if they fail.
- **Dust:** Dry adobe creates dust.
