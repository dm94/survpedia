Cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. The most common type is Portland cement, but historically, "Roman cement" was crucial.

## Description of what it is like

- **Powder:** A fine, gray powder.
- **Paste:** When mixed with water, it forms a dark gray paste.
- **Solid:** Hardens into a stone-like material that is water-resistant.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic:** Does not exist naturally in usable form; must be manufactured.
- **Raw Materials:** Limestone (Calcium) and Clay/Shale (Silica, Alumina, Iron).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mixing:** Grind limestone and clay together in specific proportions (approx. 4:1).
2.  **Burning:** Heat the mixture in a kiln to ~1450°C (sintering). This forms nodular lumps called "clinker".
3.  **Grinding:** Grind the clinker into a very fine powder.
4.  **Additives:** Usually mixed with a small amount of gypsum (to control setting time) during grinding.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **High-Temperature Kiln:** Requires much higher heat than lime or gypsum.
- **Ball Mill:** To grind clinker into fine powder.
- **Storage:** Must be kept absolutely dry.

### Common forms of use

- **Concrete:** Cement + Sand + Gravel + Water.
- **Mortar:** Cement + Sand + Water (often with lime added for workability).
- **Grout:** Cement + Water (for filling gaps).

### Possible substitutes

- **Hydraulic Lime:** Limestone containing clay, burnt at lower temps. (The historical precursor).
- **Pozzolanic Lime:** Lime mixed with volcanic ash (**[pozzolana](/en/materials/pozzolana)**) or crushed brick. This makes lime hydraulic (able to set underwater).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Shelf Life:** Absorbs moisture from air and becomes useless quickly (hard lumps).
- **Shrinkage:** Shrinks as it cures, causing cracks.
- **Rigidity:** Very rigid; can crack if the structure moves.

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical Burns:** Wet cement is highly alkaline (pH ~13) and causes severe skin burns and eye damage.
- **Silicosis:** Inhalation of dust is hazardous.
- **Heat of Hydration:** Large pours generate significant heat.

### Related materials

- **Concrete:** The main product made with cement.
- **Lime:** The simpler, non-hydraulic ancestor.
- **Clay:** The other key ingredient.
