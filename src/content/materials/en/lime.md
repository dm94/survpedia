A versatile chemical derived from limestone. It exists as Quicklime (CaO) and Slaked Lime (Ca(OH)2).

## Description of what it is like

- **Quicklime:** White, caustic lumps.
- **Slaked Lime:** White powder or putty.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Source:** Limestone (Calcium Carbonate), chalk, or seashells.
- **Process:** Produced by heating limestone to high temperatures (~900°C).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Quarrying:** Extract limestone.
2.  **[Calcination](/en/inventions/firing):** Burn in a kiln (Lime Kiln) to release CO2, creating Quicklime (CaO).
3.  **Slaking:** Add water to Quicklime to create Slaked Lime (Ca(OH)2). **DANGER:** This reaction releases intense heat.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Kiln:** To reach high temperatures.
- **Protective Gear:** To prevent burns.
- **Containers:** For slaking and storage.

### Common forms of use

- **Mortar/Plaster:** Mixed with sand and water.
- **Agriculture:** To neutralize acidic soil.
- **[Tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning):** To remove hair from hides.
- **Whitewash:** Cheap paint/sealant.

### Possible substitutes

- **Cement:** Modern alternative.
- **Clay:** For simple mortar (adobe).
- **Gypsum:** For plaster.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Carbonation:** Slaked lime hardens by absorbing CO2 from air (slow process).
- **Water:** Quicklime reacts violently with water; must be stored dry.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns:** Quicklime can cause severe thermal and chemical burns.
- **Blindness:** Contact with eyes is extremely dangerous.
- **Explosion:** If water hits stored quicklime in a confined space.
