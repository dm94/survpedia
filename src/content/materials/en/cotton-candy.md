Cotton candy is spun sugar formed into delicate, airy fibers.

## Description of what it is like

A cloud-like mass of thin sugar threads. It feels dry and light, then dissolves almost instantly on the tongue. When pressed, it becomes sticky and collapses.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever a spinning setup and dry sugar are available.
- **Signs**: Fluffy, web-like sugar on a stick or in a bag.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Dry sugar**: Granulated sugar is essential.
- **Heat and spin**: Melt and spin sugar into threads.
- **Collect and keep dry**: Gather onto a stick or into a container before it absorbs moisture.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Spinning bowl or perforated container**: Creates fine threads.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**: Heat source to melt sugar.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**: Keep it dry and serve it.

### Common forms of use

- Fluffy sugar served on a stick or in a bag.
- Decorative topping for desserts.
- Quick-energy snack for short bursts of calories.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Honey](/en/materials/honey)**: Sweet treat that stores longer.
- **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**: Used directly as crystals or syrup.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Humidity collapse**: Absorbs moisture and shrinks quickly.
- **Heat sensitivity**: Melts into syrup in warm conditions.
- **Contamination**: Dust and insects stick to exposed threads.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns**: Molten sugar causes severe burns.
- **Stickiness**: Residue attracts pests if left exposed.
