A giant woody grass that grows mainly in the tropics and subtropics. It is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world.

## Description of what it is like

Long, green, hollow stems (culms) with periodic nodes (solid joints). It is extremely tough and flexible.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Tropical forests, riverbanks, and warm temperate zones.
- **Signs:** Clumps of tall, green canes with lance-shaped leaves.
- **Natural:** It grows naturally in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Harvesting:** Cut mature stems (3-5 years old) for maximum strength.
2.  **Delimbing:** Remove branches with a machete.
3.  **Curing/Drying:** Air dry or smoke to remove moisture and sugar (to prevent beetle attack).
4.  **Working:** Split or saw to size.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Machete/Saw:** For cutting and splitting.
- **Drill/Rod:** To remove internal nodes for pipes/containers.

### Common forms of use

- **Whole Culms:** Structural posts, scaffolding, pipes.
- **Splits:** Weaving baskets, mats, walls (wattle).
- **Shoots:** Young shoots are edible (must be boiled).

### Possible substitutes

- **Wood:** For construction (heavier, slower to grow).
- **PVC/Metal:** For pipes.
- **Reed/Cane:** For weaving (weaker).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Insects:** Highly susceptible to powder-post beetles if not cured properly (starch removal).
- **Cracking:** Can split vertically if dried too fast or nailed without pre-drilling.
- **Rot:** Will rot if in direct contact with damp soil for long periods.

### Risks and safety

- **Sharp Edges:** Freshly cut bamboo edges are razor sharp.
- **Splinters:** Bamboo splinters are painful and can get infected.

### Related materials

- **Wood:** Similar structural uses.
- **Reeds:** Smaller grass relatives.
