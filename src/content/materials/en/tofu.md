Tofu is a plant-based curd made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the curds into blocks. It concentrates soybeans into a mild, versatile protein with variable firmness.

## Description of what it is like

Tofu ranges from silken and creamy to firm and sliceable depending on how much whey is pressed out. It has a mild flavor and readily absorbs seasonings.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever soybeans are grown and clean water and containers are available.
- **Signs**: Soaked and ground beans, fresh soy milk, and pressed curd blocks.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Soaking**: Soak soybeans to soften and hydrate.
- **Grinding**: Grind with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** to make a slurry.
- **Cooking**: Heat the slurry over gentle **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to make soy milk.
- **Coagulation**: Add salt-based coagulants or acids to set curds.
- **Pressing**: Drain through **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** and press to desired firmness.
- **If skipped**: Poor coagulation or pressing yields watery, fragile tofu.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for soaking and cooking.
- **Heat**: Gentle **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to cook soy milk.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for straining and pressing.
- **Weights**: Stones or simple presses to set texture.

### Common forms of use

- Fresh blocks for stir-fries and stews.
- Soft tofu for soups and sauces.
- Pressed tofu for grilling or drying.
- Fermented or smoked tofu for longer storage.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Curd & Cheese](/en/materials/curd-cheese)** when animal milk is available.
- **[Unripened Cheese](/en/materials/unripened-cheese)** for a similar soft texture.
- Cooked legumes or nut pastes for plant protein.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Fragility**: Soft tofu breaks easily without careful handling.
- **Wateriness**: Insufficient pressing produces bland, watery curd.
- **Spoilage**: High moisture makes it short-lived without cooling.
- **Off-flavors**: Poorly cooked soy milk leaves a beany taste.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Dirty tools or warm storage can spoil batches.
- **Allergies**: Soy can trigger allergic reactions.
- **Contamination**: Open processing invites mold or bacteria.
