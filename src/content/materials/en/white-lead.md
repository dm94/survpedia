White lead is a complex salt containing both carbonate and hydroxide of lead. For centuries, it was the principal white pigment used in European painting and cosmetics, despite its toxicity.

## Description of what it is like

A heavy, dense, brilliant white powder. It provides excellent coverage and opacity in oil paints.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Not natural**: Manufactured product.
- **Raw Materials**: [Lead](/en/materials/lead), [Simple Acids (Vinegar)](/en/materials/simple-acids), and a source of CO2 (manure/tanbark).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Dutch Stack Process**:
    - Place vinegar in clay pots.
    - Place lead coils/buckles inside the pots, above the vinegar.
    - Stack the pots and cover them with fermenting manure or tanbark.
    - The manure generates heat and CO2. The vinegar generates acetic acid vapors.
    - Leave for weeks/months.
2.  **Harvesting**:
    - The lead corrodes into a white crust.
    - Scrape off the crust, grind it, wash it, and dry it.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Clay pots**: Designed to hold vinegar and lead separately.
- **Sheds/Pits**: To contain the stacks and manure.
- **Grinding stones**: To process the crust into powder (do this wet to avoid dust!).

### Common forms of use

- **Paint**: The standard white pigment for centuries. Dries fast in oil.
- **Cosmetics**: Used as face powder (Venetian Ceruse) - caused severe poisoning.

### Possible substitutes

- **Titanium Dioxide**: Modern, non-toxic substitute (hard to make primitively).
- **Zinc Oxide**: Another white pigment.
- **Chalk/Lime**: Whiter but less opaque/covering power.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Blackening**: Can turn black if exposed to sulfur fumes.
- **Health**: Long-term exposure leads to severe lead poisoning (saturnism).

### Risks and safety

- **EXTREMELY TOXIC**: Inhalation or ingestion leads to cumulative lead poisoning. Symptoms include pain, madness, sterility, and death.
- **Dust**: Always grind wet to prevent dust. Wear protection.
