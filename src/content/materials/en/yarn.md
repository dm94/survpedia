A long, continuous length of interlocked fibers, used for the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, and rope making.

## Description of what it is like

Yarn appears as a thin, continuous strand of twisted fibers. It can be smooth or fuzzy, thick or thin, depending on the fiber and spinning method. It has tensile strength but is flexible.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environment**: Created in settlements or by travelers with spinning tools.
- **Signs**: Spindles, spinning wheels, or balls of thread.
- **Transformation**: Requires spinning raw fibers.

### Minimum processing required

1. **Carding/Combing**: Aligning raw fibers (wool, cotton, flax).
2. **Spinning**: Twisting the aligned fibers to lock them together and create strength.
3. **Plying** (Optional): Twisting multiple strands together for greater strength.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Spindle (Drop Spindle)**: A simple stick with a weight (whorl) to twist fibers.
- **Spinning Wheel**: A machine to speed up the spinning process.
- **Carders/Combs**: To prepare the fibers.

### Common forms of use

- **Single ply**: For fine weaving.
- **Multi-ply**: For knitting, stronger fabrics, or sewing thread.
- **Waxed**: For sewing leather or waterproofing (e.g., shoemaker's thread).

### Possible substitutes

- **Sinew**: Animal tendon (very strong, good for sewing).
- **Gut**: Intestines (for sutures or strings).
- **Strips of fabric/leather**: For rough weaving or tying.
- **Unspun roving**: Weak, breaks easily, but can be used for bulky wefts.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Untwisting**: If not properly set, it can unravel.
- **Breaking**: Under too much tension or if spun too unevenly.
- **Rot**: Natural fiber yarn decays in moisture.

### Risks and safety

- **Tangling**: Can become a mess if not wound properly.
- **Cuts**: Thin, strong thread can cut skin under tension.

### Related materials

- **Plant Fibers**: Cotton, Flax, Hemp (raw materials).
- **Wool**: Animal hair (raw material).
- **Fabric**: The product of weaving yarn.
