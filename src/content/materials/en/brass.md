Brass is a metal alloy made of copper and zinc. The proportions of zinc and copper can be varied to create a range of brasses with varying properties. It is known for its bright gold-like appearance.

## Description of what it is like

Brass has a bright golden-yellow color, similar to gold but duller. It is more malleable than bronze or zinc. It has excellent acoustic properties, making it ideal for musical instruments. Additionally, it is a material that does not produce sparks upon impact.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Does not occur naturally. Must be manufactured by mixing molten copper and zinc.
- Signs: Commonly found in decorative objects, antique instruments, or industrial scrap.
- It is a synthetic alloy.

### Minimum processing required

- Smelting: Melt the copper (1085°C) and add the zinc (419.5°C). Zinc is added at the end to prevent excessive vaporization.
- Mixing: Ensure a homogeneous mixture.
- Casting: Pour into molds for ingots or final shapes.
- Annealing: Heat and cool to restore ductility if it has been work-hardened.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Smelting furnaces.
- Crucibles (preferably graphite or fireclay).
- Molds.
- Cutting and polishing tools (files, saws).

### Common forms of use

- Red Brass: High copper content, more corrosion resistant.
- Yellow Brass: More zinc, stronger but less corrosion resistant.
- Ammunition: Cartridge casings.
- Tools: In explosive environments where sparks are not allowed.

### Possible substitutes

- Bronze: Harder and more expensive.
- Copper: Softer, better electrical conductor.
- Steel: Much stronger, but rusts (unless stainless).

### Limitations and common failures

- Dezincification: In acidic environments or saltwater, zinc can leach out, leaving a porous and weak copper structure.
- Stress Corrosion Cracking: Susceptible if under stress in the presence of ammonia.

### Risks and safety

- Metal Fume Fever: When melting, zinc vaporizes easily forming zinc oxide, which if inhaled causes flu-like symptoms. Good ventilation is required.

### Related materials

- Copper: Alloy base.
- Zinc: The other main component.
- Bronze: Sister alloy (Copper + Tin).
