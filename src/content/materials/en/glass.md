Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics.

## Importance

Glass has been essential in science for the development of lenses (telescopes, microscopes) and chemical containers, as well as in architecture for windows that provide light and protection.
