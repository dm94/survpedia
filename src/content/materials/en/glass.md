Glass is a solid inorganic, non-crystalline (amorphous) material that is typically transparent. It is essential for modern civilization, enabling everything from weather protection while maintaining light, to vision correction and chemical advancements.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Generally transparent, though it can be colored by impurities (iron gives a greenish tint) or additives.
- **Texture:** Extremely smooth and slick to the touch when cold.
- **State:** Solid at room temperature but flows like a viscous liquid at high temperatures.
- **Breakage:** Breaks with a conchoidal fracture (curved and very sharp edges).

## Origin and where to find it

Although **[Obsidian](/en/materials/obsidian)** is a natural volcanic glass used since prehistory, common glass is a synthetic material.

- **Components:**
  1.  **[Sand](/en/materials/sand) (Silica/SiO2):** The main body (approx. 70-75%). Found in beaches and dunes.
  2.  **[Soda](/en/materials/soda) (Sodium Carbonate):** Flux to lower the melting temperature. Obtained from marine plant ashes or mineral deposits.
  3.  **[Lime](/en/materials/lime) (Calcium Carbonate):** Stabilizer so the glass is not water-soluble. Obtained from [limestone](/en/materials/limestone).

### Minimum processing required

Glass requires advanced pyrotechnic technology (kilns).

1.  **Mixing:** Combine sand, soda, and lime in the correct proportions.
2.  **Melting:** Heat in a kiln or crucible to very high temperatures (>1500°C) until liquid and homogeneous.
3.  **Forming:** While hot and viscous, it can be blown, molded, or stretched.
4.  **Annealing:** Slow and controlled cooling in a special oven. This is **critical**; if cooled too fast, it accumulates internal stress and shatters spontaneously.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **High-temperature Kiln:** Capable of maintaining intense heat.
- **Crucible:** Refractory ceramic container to hold the molten mixture.
- **Blowpipe:** Hollow metal tube to gather and blow glass.
- **Jacks and Shears:** Metal tools to shape hot glass.
- **Annealing Lehr:** Oven for slow cooling.

### Common forms of use

- **Blown:** For bottles, cups, and complex shapes.
- **Flat/Float:** For windows and **[mirrors](/en/inventions/mirror)**.
- **Pressed:** For thick and uniform objects.
- **Fibers:** Stretched into fine threads for insulation (glass wool) or reinforcement (fiberglass).

### Possible substitutes

- **Windows:**
  - **Oiled Paper:** Allows diffuse light but is fragile.
  - **Flattened Horn:** Translucent and tough.
  - **Mica:** Natural mineral that splits into transparent sheets.
- **Containers:**
  - **Glazed Ceramics:** Waterproof and opaque.
  - **Metal:** Durable but reactive with acids.
- **Lenses:**
  - **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz) (Rock Crystal):** Hard to carve but optically superior.
  - **Water Droplet:** Ephemeral and primitive lens.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Thermal Shock:** Common glass breaks if temperature changes too fast (e.g., boiling water in a cold glass).
- **Brittleness:** Low impact resistance.
- **Devitrification:** If kept hot too long without fully melting, it can crystallize and become opaque and brittle.

### Risks and safety

- **Cuts:** Broken glass edges are sharper than any surgical scalpel.
- **Silicosis:** Breathing silica dust during mixture preparation is deadly in the long term.
- **Burns:** Hot glass looks the same as cold glass.
