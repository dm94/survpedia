Primitive cement, often known as **Roman Cement** or **Roman Concrete** (Opus Caementicium), is the technology that allowed ancient civilizations to build structures that have survived millennia, even underwater. Unlike simple lime mortar, this cement is **hydraulic**: it sets and hardens due to a chemical reaction with water, not by drying in the air.

## Description of what it is like

A dense, sticky paste, usually grayish or reddish (depending on the pozzolana used). Upon hardening, it becomes a monolithic mass similar to volcanic rock, extremely hard and waterproof.

## Origin and where to find it

It is a synthetic composite material. It is not found in nature, but its ingredients are.

- **Key Ingredients:**
  1.  **[Lime](/en/materials/lime):** Specifically slaked lime (calcium hydroxide).
  2.  **[Pozzolana](/en/materials/pozzolana):** The secret ingredient. Volcanic ash or very finely crushed ceramics/bricks. The amorphous silica in pozzolana reacts with the lime.
  3.  **[Water](/en/materials/water):** Fresh or salt water (Romans used seawater for marine structures successfully).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Lime Preparation:** Burn limestone to make quicklime and then slake it with water to get lime putty.
2.  **Pozzolana Preparation:** Collect volcanic ash or crush old bricks/tiles until a fine powder is obtained.
3.  **Dry Mixing:** Mix 1 part lime with 2-3 parts pozzolana.
4.  **Activation:** Add water and mix vigorously.
5.  **Placement:** Pour immediately mixed with aggregates (stones, gravel) to make concrete.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Lime Kiln:** To produce the lime.
- **Mills/Mortars:** To pulverize the pozzolana.
- **Hoes and Troughs:** For mixing.
- **Rammers:** To compact the mixture into forms (vital for strength).

### Common forms of use

- **Roman Concrete:** Mixture of primitive cement with _caementa_ (fist-sized stones). Used for domes (Pantheon), aqueducts, and walls.
- **Waterproof Coating:** To seal the inside of cisterns and pipes.
- **Bonding Mortar:** To stick bricks in very humid environments where normal lime mortar would not dry.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Lime Mortar](/en/materials/mortar):** If water resistance is not required.
- **[Clay](/en/materials/clay):** For simple structures (adobe), but washes away with rain.
- **[Cement](/en/materials/cement) (Portland):** The modern version, stronger but harder to manufacture (requires 1450°C vs 900°C for lime).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Setting Time:** It is slower than modern cement. It may take weeks or months to reach full hardness.
- **Poor Mixing:** If the pozzolana is not fine enough, the reaction will not occur fully.
- **Proportion:** Too much lime weakens the mix. Pozzolana should predominate.

### Risks and safety

- **Alkalinity:** Lime is caustic. Protect your eyes and skin.
- **Heat:** Slaking lime generates a lot of heat.
