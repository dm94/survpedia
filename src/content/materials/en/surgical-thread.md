Surgical thread, or suture, is used to hold body tissues together after an injury or surgery. It can be made from various materials, both natural and synthetic.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as a fine, flexible strand. It comes in various thicknesses (gauges) and materials. Some are dyed for better visibility.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural**: Silk (from silkworms), Catgut (processed animal intestine, usually sheep or goat).
- **Synthetic**: Nylon, Polyester, Polypropylene.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Harvesting/Synthesis**: Obtaining the raw fiber.
2.  **Spinning/Extrusion**: Forming the thread.
3.  **Sterilization**: Essential to prevent infection (boiling, alcohol, radiation).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Needle**: To pass the thread through tissue.
- **Scissors**: To cut the thread.
- **Forceps**: To handle the needle and thread.

### Common forms of use

- **Absorbable**: Breaks down in the body over time (e.g., Catgut). Used for internal tissues.
- **Non-absorbable**: Must be removed manually (e.g., Silk, Nylon). Used for skin closures.

### Possible substitutes

- **Cotton thread**: Can be used in emergencies but causes more tissue reaction.
- **Dental floss**: Strong and clean, a decent improvisation.
- **Hair**: Human or horse hair (cleaned) was used historically.
- **Fishing line**: Nylon fishing line is very similar to surgical nylon.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Infection**: If not sterile, it acts as a wick for bacteria.
- **Breaking**: If too thin or pulled too hard.
- **Reaction**: Some bodies reject certain materials (especially natural ones like gut or silk).

### Risks and safety

- **Tissue tearing**: If the thread is too strong or pulled too tight, it can cut through the tissue ("cheese-wiring").
