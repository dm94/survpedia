Clay is a fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals. It becomes plastic when wet and hardens when dried or fired.

## Description of what it is like

Clay is earthy and soft. When wet, it is highly malleable and can be shaped into almost any form. When dry, it becomes brittle but retains its shape. When fired in a kiln, it becomes stone-like and durable.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Riverbanks, lake beds, and areas with fine-grained soil.
- Signs: Slippery, sticky mud that holds its shape when squeezed. Usually found beneath the topsoil.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Extraction: Digging it out of the ground.
- Cleaning: Removing stones, roots, and organic matter.
- Levigation: Mixing with water and allowing heavier particles to settle to get a finer clay.
- Kneading/Wedging: To remove air bubbles and ensure uniform consistency.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hands:** For basic shaping and coil building.
- **[Potter's Wheel](/en/inventions/potters-wheel):** Essential for rapidly creating symmetrical vessels. Requires high-plasticity clay without coarse particles.
- **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln):** For firing and hardening the clay into ceramic.
- **Wire cutters:** For slicing clay blocks or removing pots from the wheel.

### Common forms of use

- **Raw:** For simple mud-daub construction.
- **Processed:** Dried into sun-baked **[Bricks](/en/materials/brick)** (adobe).
- **Fired:** Hardened into **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics)**, **[Pottery](/en/inventions/pottery)**, and terracotta.

### Possible substitutes

- Concrete: For construction and bricks.
- Plastic: For modern containers.
- Metal: For durable cookware.

### Limitations and common failures

- Cracking: Happens if it dries too quickly or unevenly.
- Shrinkage: Clay loses volume as it dries and fires.
- Water Damage: Unfired clay will dissolve back into mud if it gets wet.

### Risks and safety

- Dust: Dry clay dust can be harmful if inhaled (silicosis risk).
- Burns: During the firing process in kilns.

### Related materials

- **[Water](/en/materials/water):** Essential for making clay malleable.
- **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics):** The final product of fired clay.
- **[Brick](/en/materials/brick):** A common construction material made from clay.
