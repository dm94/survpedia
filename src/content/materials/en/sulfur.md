Sulfur (brimstone) is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. It is essential for life and industry, particularly for making sulfuric acid and gunpowder.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Bright yellow powder or crystals.
- **Smell:** Odorless in pure form, but burning it produces sulfur dioxide (smell of burnt matches). Compounds like hydrogen sulfide smell like rotten eggs.
- **Combustion:** Burns with a blue flame.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Volcanic regions (fumaroles), salt domes, and hot springs.
- **Signs:** Yellow deposits around vents or in rocks.
- **Natural:** Occurs as native element.

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection:** Scraping from deposits.
- **Purification:** Melting (Frasch process or simple heating) to separate from rock.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Shovel/Scraper:** For collection.
- **Pot/Retort:** For melting/purifying (melts at ~115°C).

### Common forms of use

- **Powder:** Flowers of sulfur for agriculture/medicine.
- **Solid blocks:** Cast sulfur.
- **Molten:** For casting or bonding (sulfur concrete).

### Possible substitutes

- **Pyrite:** Source of sulfur/sulfuric acid but requires roasting.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Flammability:** Catches fire easily.
- **Brittleness:** Pure sulfur is fragile.

### Risks and safety

- **SO2 Gas:** Burning produces toxic sulfur dioxide gas.
- **Acid:** Mixing with water/humidity can form weak acids.
