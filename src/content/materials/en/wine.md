Wine is a fermented beverage made primarily from grape juice. It concentrates sugars, acids, and aromas into a stable drink that can be stored and transported.

## Description of what it is like

An aromatic liquid that ranges from pale straw to deep red. It is mildly acidic, usually 9–15% alcohol by volume, and can be dry or sweet depending on residual sugar.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever grapes or other sugary fruits are available and fermentation vessels exist.
- **Signs**: Bubbly, sweet juice turning fragrant and alcoholic.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Crushing**: Break grapes to release juice (must).
- **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)**: Yeast converts sugars to alcohol in a covered container.
- **Separation**: Rack or strain the liquid to remove solids and sediment.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** bottles or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** barrels for fermentation and aging.
- **Primary container**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** jar or a clean **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **Strainer**: Clean **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or woven fiber cloth.
- **Seals**: **[Cork](/en/materials/cork)** or tight stoppers for storage.

### Common forms of use

- **Red wine**: Fermented with skins for color and tannin.
- **White wine**: Fermented without skins for lighter body.
- **Rosé**: Short skin contact for light color.
- **Sparkling**: Carbonated by secondary fermentation.
- **Fortified**: Strengthened with added alcohol after fermentation.

### Possible substitutes

- Other fermented beverages made from grains or honey.
- Diluted **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** for tinctures or cooking.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Oxidation**: Air exposure turns wine sour or stale.
- **Contamination**: Unclean tools create off-flavors or spoilage.
- **Temperature sensitivity**: Excess heat can stall fermentation or cook flavors.

### Risks and safety

- **Intoxication**: Impairs judgment and coordination.
- **Health risks**: Excessive consumption damages organs and increases addiction risk.
- **Pressure**: Sealed fermentation can burst containers if CO2 builds up.

### Related materials

- **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**: The fermentation agent.
- **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**: Fermentable substrate (present in grapes or added).
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: Used for cleaning and diluting must when needed.
- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: The primary product of fermentation.
- **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**: Formed if wine oxidizes and turns acetic.
- **[Cork](/en/materials/cork)**: Traditional bottle seal.
- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**: Common storage vessel.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: Used for barrel aging.
