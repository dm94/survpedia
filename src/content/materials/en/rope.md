Rope is a strong, thick cord made by twisting or braiding together strands of fibers, wire, or other material. It is essential for heavy-duty tasks where string or yarn would break.

## Description of what it is like

Rope is thicker and stronger than string (typically >4mm diameter). It has a coarse texture if made from natural fibers like hemp or manila. It can be stiff when new but becomes more flexible with use.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Not found in nature**: Must be manufactured.
- **Raw Materials**:
  - **Natural**: Hemp, manila, sisal, cotton, coir (coconut fiber).
  - **Synthetic**: Nylon, polypropylene, polyester (modern).
  - **Wire**: Steel strands (for suspension bridges).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Fiber Preparation**: Cleaning and combing fibers (heckling).
2.  **Spinning**: Twisting fibers into yarns.
3.  **Forming**: Twisting yarns into strands.
4.  **Laying**: Twisting three or more strands together to form the rope. The twist must be balanced to keep the rope straight.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Ropewalk**: A long space for laying out strands.
- **Rope jack/Spinner**: To twist the strands.
- **Top**: A grooved wooden block to guide the twist.
- **Knife/Fid**: For cutting and splicing.

### Common forms of use

- **Twisted (Laid)**: Most common, easy to splice.
- **Braided**: Smoother, less likely to kink.
- **Cable**: Rope made by twisting other ropes together (very thick).

### Possible substitutes

- **[Chain](/en/inventions/chain)**: Stronger, more durable, but heavier and not elastic.
- **Steel Cable**: For modern high-strength applications.
- **Vine/Lianas**: Primitive natural substitute (unprocessed).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rot**: Natural fiber ropes rot when stored wet.
- **Fraying**: External fibers wear out from abrasion.
- **Internal wear**: Grit can get inside and cut fibers.
- **Snapback**: If a rope breaks under tension, it can snap back with deadly force.

### Risks and safety

- **Burn**: Fast-moving rope can cause friction burns.
- **Entanglement**: Risk of getting caught in coils.
- **Breaking limit**: Always know the Safe Working Load (SWL), usually much lower than the breaking strength.
