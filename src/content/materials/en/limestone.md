Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It is one of the most useful and abundant minerals in history, serving as a building block and a chemical raw material.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Solid rock, usually white, gray, or beige.
- **Texture:** Can be fine-grained (chalk) or coarse-grained (fossiliferous).
- **Reaction:** Bubbles vigorously when in contact with acid (like vinegar).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Marine Environments:** Formed from the accumulation of shells, coral, and algae debris in shallow seas over millions of years.
- **Caves:** Stalactites and stalagmites are limestone forms (travertine).
- **Mountains:** Many mountain ranges are uplifted seabeds rich in limestone.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Quarrying:** Extracted from the ground using picks, wedges, or explosives.
2.  **Crushing:** Broken down into smaller chunks for transport or processing.
3.  **Cutting:** Cut into blocks for construction.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pickaxe/Sledgehammer:** For extraction.
- **Chisel:** For shaping blocks.
- **Kiln:** For converting it into lime (chemical use).

### Common forms of use

- **Blocks:** As "dimension stone" for walls and buildings (e.g., the Pyramids).
- **Crushed:** As road base or aggregate for concrete.
- **Powder:** As agricultural lime to fix acidic soil.
- **Raw Material:** Burnt to make Quicklime (CaO).

### Possible substitutes

- **Sandstone/Granite:** For construction (harder to work).
- **Wood:** For building (less durable).
- **Seashells:** Can be burnt to make lime if rock limestone is unavailable.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Acid Rain:** Dissolves slowly over time in acidic environments.
- **Softness:** Not as hard as granite; wears down in high-traffic areas.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** Inhalation of limestone dust can cause respiratory irritation.
- **Heavy Lifting:** Blocks are extremely heavy.

### Related materials

- **Lime:** Produced by burning limestone.
- **Marble:** Metamorphosed limestone (harder, shinier).
- **Chalk:** Soft, porous limestone.
