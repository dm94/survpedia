Pearl is a hard, glossy material produced by certain mollusks as they coat an irritant with layers of nacre.

## Description of what it is like

Pearls are smooth, rounded or irregular nodules with a bright, pearly luster. Their surface can range from mirror-like to softly matte depending on polish and wear.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Coastal lagoons, estuaries, and sheltered bays with oysters or mussels.
- Signs: Healthy shellfish beds and clean, well-oxygenated water.
- It is a natural material, though many pearls are cultured.

### Minimum processing required

- Cleaning: Rinse to remove salts and organic residue.
- Sorting: Grade by size, luster, and surface quality.
- Drying: Air-dry before storage.
- Drilling: Small holes for stringing, if needed.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Soft cloths and sieves for cleaning.
- Fine drill or bow drill for holes.
- Abrasives for gentle polishing.

### Common forms of use

- Raw: Collected and stored as trade goods.
- Polished: Enhanced luster for jewelry.
- Inlay: Set into wood, metal, or stone for decoration.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**: Beads that imitate luster.
- **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**: Carved beads with a similar size profile.

### Limitations and common failures

- Acid damage: Vinegar, sweat, or acidic soils can dull or pit the surface.
- Heat and dryness: Excess heat or dehydration can crack nacre layers.
- Scratching: Softer than most stones and metals.

### Risks and safety

- Dust: Drilling creates fine dust that should not be inhaled.
- Loss of luster: Oils and abrasives can permanently reduce shine.
