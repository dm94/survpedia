Cheese is curd transformed by salting, pressing, and aging to concentrate nutrients and extend storage. It converts fresh milk into a durable, portable food with diverse textures and flavors.

## Description of what it is like

Cheese ranges from soft and creamy to hard and brittle. Aging deepens aroma and taste, while moisture content controls texture and melt behavior.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever **[Livestock](/en/knowledge/livestock)** provide milk and cool, clean spaces allow aging.
- **Signs**: Stored wheels or blocks, brine vats, and drying racks.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Curd formation**: Start with fresh curd from acid or rennet coagulation.
- **Draining**: Remove whey to control moisture.
- **Salting**: Dry salt or brine to stabilize and flavor.
- **Pressing/Aging**: Press for firmness and age in a cool, clean place.
- **If skipped**: High moisture and low salt lead to rapid spoilage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Heat**: Gentle **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for controlled warming.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining and wrapping.
- **Weights**: Stones or simple presses for shaping.

### Common forms of use

- Fresh cheeses for immediate meals.
- Semi-hard cheeses for cooking and storage.
- Hard, aged cheeses for long travel.
- Grated or melted cheese as seasoning.

### Possible substitutes

- Dried or salted meats for long storage protein.
- Dried legumes or nuts when animal milk is unavailable.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Spoilage**: Warm storage or dirty tools can ruin batches.
- **Cracking**: Over-drying during aging splits the rind.
- **Unwanted mold**: Poor airflow or excess humidity causes off-flavors.
- **Salt imbalance**: Too little salt spoils; too much makes it inedible.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk and poor sanitation can carry pathogens.
- **Allergies**: Dairy proteins can trigger reactions.
- **Histamine**: Aged cheeses can affect sensitive people.
