# Brief description

Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2%. It is known for its relatively low melting point, good fluidity, castability, excellent machinability, resistance to deformation and wear.

## Description of what it is like

It is a hard, grey metal (unless white cast iron). It has a crystalline fracture. It is very heavy and rigid but brittle—it will crack or shatter if struck hard, rather than bending like steel or wrought iron.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Man-made:** It is produced in a **[Blast Furnace](/en/inventions/furnace)** or cupola furnace.
- **Source:** Pig iron (crude iron from the blast furnace) is remelted, often with scrap iron and steel, and cast into molds.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Melting:** Heating pig iron, scrap, and limestone to liquid state.
2.  **Casting:** Pouring the molten metal into sand molds or metal dies.
3.  **Cooling:** allowing it to solidify.
4.  **Cleaning:** Removing the sand and gates/risers (fettling).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Furnace:** To melt the iron.
- **Molds:** Usually made of sand mixed with clay (**[Green Sand](/en/materials/sand)**).
- **Files/Grinders:** To smooth the rough casting.
- **Machine Tools:** Lathes and mills to machine precise surfaces (it machines very well, producing short chips).

### Common forms of use

- **Grey Cast Iron:** Most common. Good damping (absorbs vibration) and machinability. Used for machine bases and engine blocks.
- **White Cast Iron:** Very hard and wear-resistant but brittle. Used for crushing equipment.
- **Ductile Iron (Nodular):** Magnesium is added to make it less brittle and more flexible (like steel). Pipes, automotive parts.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**: Stronger and tougher, but harder to cast complex shapes and dampens vibration less.
- **[Wrought Iron](/en/materials/iron)**: Tougher but softer and cannot be cast (must be forged).
- **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**: For heavy machine bases (polymer concrete).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Brittleness:** The biggest weakness. Do not use for parts subject to high tensile stress or shock loading (unless ductile iron).
- **Cracking:** uneven cooling can cause internal stresses and cracks.
- **Rust:** Corrodes easily if not protected (painted or oiled).

### Risks and safety

- **Molten Metal:** Casting involves extreme heat (1200°C+). Splash burns are fatal.
- **Heavy:** Castings are very dense and heavy.
