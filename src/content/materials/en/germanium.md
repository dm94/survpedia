# Brief description

Germanium is a lustrous, hard-brittle, grayish-white metalloid. It was the first material used for transistors before silicon became dominant.

## Properties

- **Semiconductivity:** Like silicon, its conductivity can be controlled.
- **Optical:** Transparent to infrared radiation, making it useful for thermal cameras.
- **Refraction:** High index of refraction.

## Usage

- **Electronics:** Used in the first generation of transistors and diodes (germanium diodes are still used in crystal radios).
- **Optics:** Lenses for infrared cameras and spectroscopes.
- **Communications:** Dopant in fiber optic cables.

## Manufacturing/Extraction

Extracted mainly as a by-product of zinc ore processing.

1.  **Concentration:** Germanium concentrates are chlorinated to produce germanium tetrachloride.
2.  **Purification:** Distilled for high purity.
3.  **Hydrolysis:** Hydrolyzed to oxide (GeO2).
4.  **Reduction:** Reduced with hydrogen to produce germanium metal.
