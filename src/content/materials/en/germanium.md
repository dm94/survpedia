# Brief description

Germanium is a lustrous, hard-brittle, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors silicon and tin. It was the first material used for transistors and solid-state electronics before silicon became dominant due to silicon's superior thermal properties and abundance.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Metallic, silvery-white, shiny but brittle (shatters like glass).
- **State:** Solid at room temperature.
- **Conductivity:** A semiconductor; conducts electricity better than an insulator but worse than a metal. Its conductivity increases with temperature (unlike metals).

## Origin and where to find it

Germanium is not found as a free element in nature. It is a dispersed element.

- **Zinc Ores:** It is most commonly found as a trace impurity in sphalerite (zinc ore).
- **Coal Ash:** Some coal deposits contain significant amounts of germanium. It can be recovered from the fly ash of power plants burning this coal.
- **Minerals:** Rare minerals like argyrodite and germanite contain it, but they are scarce.

### Minimum processing required

Extracting germanium is a complex chemical process, difficult to achieve in a primitive setting.

1.  **Concentration:** Germanium-bearing fumes or residues (from zinc processing or coal burning) are collected.
2.  **Chlorination:** The concentrate is treated with hydrochloric acid and chlorine to produce Germanium Tetrachloride (GeCl4), a volatile liquid.
3.  **Distillation:** The GeCl4 is distilled to separate it from other impurities (like arsenic). This is the key purification step.
4.  **Hydrolysis:** The purified GeCl4 is reacted with water to precipitate pure Germanium Dioxide (GeO2), a white powder.
5.  **Reduction:** The oxide is reduced in a furnace with hydrogen gas or charcoal to produce metallic Germanium.
6.  **Zone Refining:** For electronics, the metal bar is melted in a moving zone to sweep remaining impurities to one end, achieving 99.9999999% purity.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Chemical Glassware:** Retorts, condensers (for distillation).
- **High-Temperature Furnace:** Capable of reaching ~1000°C.
- **Hydrogen Source:** For reduction (dangerous).
- **Zone Refiner:** A specialized heater that moves slowly along a tube.

### Common forms of use

- **Semiconductor Crystal:** Grown into single crystals for slicing into wafers (for transistors/diodes).
- **Lenses:** Cast into shapes for infrared cameras (it looks like opaque metal to eyes but is clear glass to heat/IR).
- **Alloy:** Added to solder or other metals.

### Possible substitutes

- **Silicon:** The modern standard. More abundant (sand), better heat tolerance, but harder to purify and melt.
- **Galena (Lead Sulfide):** A natural semiconductor mineral. Can be used raw for "crystal radio" diodes (cat's whisker detectors) without complex processing.
- **Vacuum Tubes:** The low-tech alternative to semiconductors.
- **Copper Oxide:** Can be used for primitive rectifiers (diodes).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Heat Sensitivity:** Germanium transistors stop working at relatively low temperatures (~75°C / 167°F) because they become too conductive. This is why silicon replaced it.
- **Leakage Current:** Older germanium devices tend to have higher leakage current than silicon ones.
- **Cost/Rarity:** Much rarer than silicon.

### Risks and safety

- **Toxicity:** Elemental germanium is considered low-toxicity, but some compounds (like Germanium Hydride / Germane) are extremely toxic and flammable.
- **Chemical Hazards:** The extraction process involves chlorine and hydrochloric acid, which are corrosive and toxic gases.
- **Hydrogen Explosion:** Reducing with hydrogen carries a high risk of explosion.

### Related materials

- **Silicon:** Its periodic table sibling and successor.
- **Zinc:** The primary host ore.
- **Arsenic/Gallium:** Common dopants used with it.
