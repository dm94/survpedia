Beer is a fermented drink made from grain sugars and **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**. It is an accessible, low-strength alcohol that can be produced with basic tools and clean water.

## Description of what it is like

It is a cloudy to clear liquid with a foamy head and a mild to strong bitterness. Flavors range from bready and malty to sour or roasted, depending on grains and fermentation.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever grains like **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)**, **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)**, or **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)** are available and fermentation vessels exist.
- **Signs**: Sweet grain mash turning fizzy and aromatic as it ferments.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Malting**: Soak grain, allow to sprout briefly, then dry to unlock enzymes.
- **Mashing**: Mix crushed malt with hot **[Water](/en/materials/water)** to extract sugars.
- **Boiling**: Boil the wort and add bitter herbs for stability and flavor.
- **Fermentation**: Cool and add **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** in a covered **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **If skipped**: Dirty tools or warm storage spoil the batch quickly.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots, **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** jars, or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** barrels.
- **Heat**: Steady **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for mashing and boiling.
- **Strainer**: Clean **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for separating grain solids.
- **Cooling space**: A clean, shaded area for safe fermentation temperatures.

### Common forms of use

- **Fresh ale**: Low alcohol, drunk young.
- **Dark beer**: Roasted grain flavor and fuller body.
- **Sour beer**: More acidic from mixed fermentation.
- **Stronger beer**: Higher malt load for better storage.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Wine](/en/materials/wine)** when fruit sugars are available.
- **[Honey](/en/materials/honey)** for mead-style fermentation.
- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** diluted for cooking uses.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Contamination**: Poor sanitation causes sour or spoiled batches.
- **Temperature swings**: Too hot kills yeast; too cold stalls fermentation.
- **Oxidation**: Excess air makes flavors dull or papery.

### Risks and safety

- **Intoxication**: Impairs judgment and coordination.
- **Pressure buildup**: Sealed fermentation can burst containers.
- **Health risks**: Excessive consumption harms organs and increases addiction risk.

- **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)**: Common grain base.
- **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)**: Alternative grain for lighter beers.
- **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)**: Grain extender in many brews.

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: Primary product of fermentation.
