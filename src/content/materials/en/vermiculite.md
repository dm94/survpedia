Vermiculite is a hydrous phyllosilicate mineral that undergoes significant expansion when heated. It is very similar to **[Perlite](/en/materials/perlite)** but holds more water and is chemically distinct.

## Description of what it is like

- **Raw**: Looks like shiny, dark flakes of mica.
- **Exfoliated (Expanded)**: Worm-like, accordion-shaped granules that are golden-brown or bronze in color.
- **Texture**: Soft, spongy, and very light.
- **Odorless** and chemically inert.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural**: Mined from open-pit mines. Major deposits exist in South Africa, China, and the USA.
- **Appearance**: Often found alongside other minerals like mica and quartz.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mining**: Extraction of the ore.
2.  **Concentration**: Separating vermiculite from other rocks.
3.  **Exfoliation**: Rapid heating in a furnace to ~900°C. The water trapped between the layers turns to steam, forcing the layers apart (exfoliation).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Furnace**: Essential for expansion.
- **Mixer**: For combining with cement or soil.
- **Bags**: For storage (it blows away easily).

### Common forms of use

- **Loose-fill Insulation**: Poured into attics or hollow concrete blocks.
- **Insulating Concrete**: Mixed with **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)** to create lightweight roof decks or floor screeds.
- **Horticulture**: Mixed with soil to retain moisture and nutrients (holds much more water than perlite).
- **Fireproofing**: Mixed with gypsum or cement and sprayed onto steel structures.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Perlite](/en/materials/perlite)**: Better for insulation where moisture is a concern (holds less water).
- **[Polystyrene](/en/materials/polystyrene)** beads: Lighter but flammable.
- **Sawdust**: For lightweight concrete (but rots).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Water Retention**: Absorbs a lot of water. If used as insulation in damp areas, it loses its insulating value and can cause rot in adjacent wood.
- **Compression**: The granules are soft and can be crushed easily.
- **Settling**: Loose-fill vermiculite can settle over time, leaving uninsulated gaps.

### Risks and safety

- **Asbestos Contamination**: Historically (especially from the Libby, Montana mine), some vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos. Modern sources are tested and safe, but old insulation should be treated with caution.
- **Dust**: Inhalation of mineral dust is always a respiratory hazard.
