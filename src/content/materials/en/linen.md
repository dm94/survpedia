Linen is a textile fiber made from the flax plant, valued for its strength, cool feel, and durability.

## Description of what it is like

Linen fibers are long, smooth, and slightly stiff with a natural luster. Linen cloth feels crisp and cool, softening with repeated use and washing.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Temperate fields where flax is cultivated.
- **Signs**: Slender stalks with blue flowers; retted bundles or pale fibers ready for spinning.
- **Natural**: A plant fiber that requires processing.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Pulling flax to preserve long fibers.
- **Retting**: Dew or water retting to loosen fibers from the stem.
- **Breaking/Scutching**: Removing the woody core and debris.
- **Hackling**: Combing fibers straight for spinning.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Knives or sickles**: For harvest.
- **Retting tanks or fields**: For fiber separation.
- **Breaks and scutching blades**: For cleaning fibers.
- **Hackles, spindle, or spinning wheel**: For spinning.

### Common forms of use

- **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)**: Spun linen yarn for weaving and sewing.
- **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**: Linen cloth for garments and household textiles.
- **Cordage**: Twine, thread, and light rope.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**: Softer and more elastic but less crisp.
- **[Wool](/en/materials/wool)**: Warmer and more elastic, less breathable.
- **Other plant fibers**: Flax alternatives like hemp or nettle fiber.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Wrinkling**: Creases easily without finishing.
- **Brittleness when over-dry**: Fibers can weaken if stored too dry for long periods.
- **Abrasion**: Fine linen can wear through at high-friction points.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust**: Hackling and spinning release fine fibers that can irritate lungs.
- **Water hazards**: Retting ponds can become contaminated and require safe handling.
