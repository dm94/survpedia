A composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over time.

## Description of what it is like

Initially a semi-liquid slurry that can be poured into molds. When cured, it becomes a rock-hard substance, grey in color, with high compressive strength but low tensile strength.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Artificial:** It must be manufactured.
- **History:** Used extensively by Romans (Roman Concrete) using volcanic ash (**[pozzolana](/en/materials/pozzolana)**) and lime.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Preparation:** Gather sand, gravel (aggregate), binder (lime or cement), and water.
2.  **Mixing:** Thoroughly mix ingredients in correct proportions (e.g., 1 part binder, 2 parts sand, 3 parts gravel).
3.  **Pouring:** Place into forms/molds immediately.
4.  **Curing:** Keep moist for several days to allow chemical hardening (hydration).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mixing:** Shovels, hoes, mixing box or trough.
- **Forms:** Wood planks to create molds.
- **Tamping:** Rods to remove air bubbles.

### Common forms of use

- **Mass Concrete:** For dams or large foundations.
- **Reinforced Concrete:** Combined with steel (rebar) to add tensile strength (modern).
- **Mortar:** Finer mix for bonding bricks/stones.

### Possible substitutes

- **Stone:** Harder to shape but natural.
- **Brick:** Requires firing but modular.
- **Wood:** For structures (but rot/fire risk).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Cracking:** Shrinkage during drying or structural shifts.
- **Setting Time:** Must be used quickly after mixing.
- **Temperature:** Freezing during curing ruins it.

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical Burns:** Wet concrete/lime is highly alkaline and can burn skin.
- **Dust:** Silica dust from dry mixing is harmful to lungs.
- **Weight:** Very heavy.

- **Sand/Gravel:** The aggregate.
- **Mortar:** Similar but without coarse aggregate.
