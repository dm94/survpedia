Sulfuric acid is a strong mineral acid. It is colorless, odorless, and viscous. It is one of the most important industrial chemicals.

## Description of what it is like

A clear, oily liquid that is extremely corrosive. It generates significant heat when mixed with water.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Not natural**: Does not exist naturally in free form on Earth in significant quantities (except in acid rain or volcanic lakes).
- **Raw Materials**: Sulfur (from volcanic deposits or pyrite), oxygen, and water.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Combustion**: Burning sulfur or roasting sulfide ores (like pyrite) to produce sulfur dioxide (SO2).
2.  **Oxidation**: Converting SO2 to sulfur trioxide (SO3) using a catalyst (vanadium oxide in modern times, or nitrogen oxides in the Lead Chamber process).
3.  **Hydration**: Dissolving SO3 in water (usually absorbed into existing acid first to avoid explosion) to form H2SO4.
    - **Primitive Method**: "Oil of Vitriol" was made by distilling "green vitriol" (iron sulfate) which naturally occurs as a weathering product of pyrite.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Glass or Ceramic containers**: It corrodes most metals.
- **Distillation apparatus**: For the vitriol method.
- **Lead chambers**: For the 18th-century industrial method (lead resists sulfuric acid).

### Common forms of use

- **Dilute**: Used as battery acid (electrolyte).
- **Concentrated**: Used for dehydration or chemical synthesis.

### Possible substitutes

- **Vinegar (Acetic Acid)**: For very weak acid needs (not suitable for high-power batteries).
- **Citric Acid**: Weak acid.
- **Hydrochloric Acid**: Can be produced from salt and sulfuric acid, but is volatile.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Water reaction**: ALWAYS add acid to water, never water to acid, or it may boil and splash.
- **Corrosion**: Eats through organic material (skin, wood, cloth) and most metals quickly.
