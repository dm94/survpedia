Gunpowder (black powder) is a granular propellant made from potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur. It releases large volumes of hot gas when ignited, making it useful for propulsion and controlled blasting.

## Description of what it is like

It appears as dark gray to black grains or powder. It is dusty, slightly oily to the touch, and burns rapidly with a bright flash and heavy smoke.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Components**: Potassium nitrate (saltpeter), charcoal, and sulfur are sourced separately.
- **Saltpeter sources**: Nitrate-rich soils, compost heaps, or mineral deposits processed into potassium nitrate.
- **Charcoal sources**: Kilns or covered pits that convert wood into charcoal.
- **Sulfur sources**: Volcanic deposits or sulfur-bearing minerals.
- It is a manufactured material.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Refine ingredients**: Dry and grind each component to a fine powder.
2.  **Blend**: Mix to a consistent ratio while keeping the mixture slightly damp.
3.  **Press and granulate**: Compress into cakes, then break into grains.
4.  **Dry and screen**: Dry thoroughly and sort grain sizes for consistent burn rate.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Non-sparking grinders or mortars.
- Screens or sieves for grading grain size.
- Pressing tools and a drying area with good airflow.

### Common forms of use

- **Fine grains**: Priming and fast-ignition applications.
- **Medium grains**: Small arms and **[Fireworks](/en/inventions/fireworks)** lift charges.
- **Coarse grains**: Cannons and quarry blasting.

### Possible substitutes

- **Compressed air or springs**: Mechanical propulsion for small projectiles.
- **Smokeless propellants**: Modern alternatives with higher energy density.
- **Mechanical wedges and water pressure**: For some blasting or splitting tasks.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture uptake**: Absorbs water and loses power.
- **Inconsistent burn**: Poor mixing or grain sizing causes erratic performance.
- **Caking**: Fine powder can pack and ignite unevenly.

### Risks and safety

- **Ignition hazards**: Sparks, static, and friction can trigger ignition.
- **Explosive confinement**: Pressure build-up can cause catastrophic failure.
- **Toxic smoke**: Produces irritating gases and dense smoke in enclosed spaces.
