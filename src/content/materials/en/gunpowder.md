## History

Gunpowder (or Black Powder) is one of the "Four Great Inventions" of China. Discovered in the 9th century by Taoist alchemists searching for an elixir of life. By the 11th century, it was used in bombs and fire arrows. It spread to the Middle East and Europe via the Silk Road.

## Properties

It is a low explosive, meaning it deflagrates (subsonic combustion) rather than detonating. This makes it suitable for propelling projectiles without destroying the gun barrel. The mixture consists of a fuel (charcoal), an oxidizer (potassium nitrate/saltpeter), and a stabilizer (sulfur).

## Manufacturing

The traditional ratio is 75:15:10 (Saltpeter:Charcoal:Sulfur). The ingredients are ground separately into fine powders and then mixed (often wet, to reduce ignition risk) and "corned" into grains to improve burning consistency.
