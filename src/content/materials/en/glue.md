Glue is an adhesive substance used to bind materials together. Historically, the most common strong glues were made from animal collagen.

## Description of what it is like

Animal glue is typically sold as hard, brittle, amber-colored granules, sheets, or blocks. When soaked in water and heated, it becomes a viscous, sticky liquid. As it cools and dries, it hardens and bonds surfaces together.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Anywhere animals are butchered or processed.
- **Signs**: It is a byproduct of processing animal parts (hides, hooves, bones).
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection**: Gather scraps of hide, connective tissue, bones, or hooves.
2.  **Cleaning**: Wash to remove dirt and blood. Soaking in lime water helps break down the tissue but must be rinsed off.
3.  **Boiling**: Simmer the material in water for several hours to extract the collagen.
4.  **Straining**: Filter out the solid residue.
5.  **Reduction**: Simmer the liquid further to evaporate water and thicken it.
6.  **Drying**: Pour into molds or trays to gel and dry into hard cakes for storage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Pot**: For boiling.
- **Heat source**: Fire or stove.
- **Strainer**: Cloth or mesh.
- **Glue Pot**: A double boiler is essential for reheating the glue without burning it.

### Common forms of use

- **Hot Glue**: Applied warm and liquid; sets as it cools (Hide Glue).
- **Liquid Glue**: Treated with additives (like urea or vinegar) to stay liquid at room temperature (Fish Glue).
- **Gelatin**: A purer form used for sizing paper or food.

### Possible substitutes

- **Resin/Pitch**: For waterproof or gap-filling needs (but brittle).
- **Starch Paste**: Made from flour or rice, good for paper but weaker for wood.
- **Casein Glue**: Made from milk curds and lime, very strong and water-resistant.
- **Modern Glues**: PVA, Epoxy, Superglue.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: Animal glue is water-soluble and will fail in damp conditions or if it gets wet.
- **Heat**: It softens when heated (which makes it reversible, a benefit for instrument repair).
- **Spoilage**: Liquid glue can mold or rot if not preserved.

### Risks and safety

- **Burns**: Handling hot glue pots.
- **Smell**: Boiling bones and hides can produce a strong, unpleasant odor.

### Related materials

- **Leather**: Made from the same raw material (hides).
- **Bone**: A source of glue.
- **Wood**: The primary material bonded with glue.
- **Water**: The solvent for the glue.
- **Resin**: An alternative adhesive.
