Processed cheese is a re-melted dairy product made by blending cheese or curd with moisture and salt, then heating until it emulsifies into a uniform paste. It improves melt behavior, consistency, and short-term storage stability.

## Description of what it is like

It is smooth and uniform, with a mild, salty flavor. It melts evenly and stays cohesive rather than separating into oil and solids.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever dairy is available and there is controlled heating and clean storage.
- **Signs**: Smooth, uniform blocks or slices, often wrapped or stored in sealed containers.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Blending**: Combine curd or cheese with a small amount of **[Water](/en/materials/water)** or milk to control moisture.
- **Salting**: Add **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** for flavor and stability.
- **Heating**: Gently heat while stirring to create a stable emulsion.
- **Forming**: Pour into molds and cool to set.
- **If skipped**: The mix separates, becomes grainy, or melts into oil.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for mixing and heating.
- **Heat**: Steady **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to warm without scorching.
- **Stirring tools**: Paddles or spoons, often **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**.
- **Cooling surfaces**: Boards or molds lined with **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**.

### Common forms of use

- Slices for fast meals and travel rations.
- Spreadable blocks for bread and starches.
- Melting base for sauces and soups.
- Filling for cooked foods.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Cheese](/en/materials/cheese)** for stronger flavor but uneven melting.
- **[Unripened Cheese](/en/materials/unripened-cheese)** for short-term use with less stability.
- **[Curd & Cheese](/en/materials/curd-cheese)** when reheating and blending is not possible.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Separation**: Too little salt or uneven heat makes it oily.
- **Scorching**: High heat burns proteins and ruins flavor.
- **Over-dilution**: Too much liquid makes it weak and runny.
- **Flat flavor**: Overprocessing can mute complexity.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Poor sanitation or warm storage spoils dairy.
- **Allergies**: Dairy proteins can trigger reactions.
- **High sodium**: Heavy salting can be unsuitable for some diets.
