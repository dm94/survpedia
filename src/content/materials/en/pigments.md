Pigments are finely ground, insoluble solid particles that are used to impart color to other materials, such as paint, ink, plastic, fabric, and cosmetics. Unlike dyes, pigments do not dissolve in the medium but remain suspended in it.

## Description of what it is like

Pigments appear as fine, colored powders. The color intensity and coverage depend on the fineness of the grind and the purity of the material. They range from dull earth tones (ochres, umbers) to vibrant hues (ultramarine, vermilion).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Earth Pigments**: Found in soil and clay (Ochres, Siennas, Umbers). Common in riverbanks or exposed cliffs.
- **Mineral Pigments**: Mined from specific rocks. Malachite (green), Azurite (blue), Cinnabar (red/vermilion), Lapis Lazuli (ultramarine).
- **Organic Pigments**: Charred wood or bone (Carbon Black, Bone Black), or plant lakes (though lakes are dyes attached to a pigment base).
- **Synthetic Pigments**: Created through chemical reactions (e.g., Prussian Blue, Lead White).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Collection**: Mining the mineral or collecting the organic source.
2.  **Grinding**: Using a mortar and pestle or mill to crush the material into a fine powder. Coarse particles make gritty paint.
3.  **Washing (Levigation)**: Mixing the powder with water to separate heavy impurities (which sink) from fine pigment particles (which stay suspended longer), then decanting.
4.  **Drying**: Removing moisture from the refined pigment paste.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mortar and Pestle**: For initial crushing and grinding.
- **Grinding Slab and Muller**: A flat stone and a heavy, flat-bottomed stone to grind the pigment into a very fine paste with water.
- **Bowls/Jars**: For washing and settling.
- **Sieves**: To remove large debris.

### Common forms of use

- **Dry Powder**: Stored for later use.
- **Paste**: Mixed with water or oil for immediate paint making.
- **Cakes**: Pressed pigment (sometimes with a little binder) for storage.

### Possible substitutes

- **Dyes**: Soluble colorants derived from plants (berries, roots). They are often less lightfast and less opaque than pigments.
- **Colored Clays**: Can be used directly as crude pigment.
- **Ash/Charcoal**: Readily available substitute for black pigment.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Fading (Fugitive Colors)**: Some pigments lose color when exposed to sunlight (UV).
- **Toxicity**: Many historical pigments are toxic (Lead White, Cinnabar/Mercury, Orpiment/Arsenic).
- **Incompatibility**: Some pigments react chemically with certain binders or other pigments (e.g., copper pigments can spoil in oil).

### Risks and safety

- **Inhalation**: Breathing fine dust is dangerous (Silicosis, heavy metal poisoning). Always wear a mask or grind wet.
- **Toxicity**: Handle minerals like Malachite, Cinnabar, and Lead with extreme care. Wash hands thoroughly.

### Related materials

- **Paint**: The primary application of pigments (Pigment + Binder).
- **Ink**: Pigments suspended in a liquid for writing.
- **Binder**: The substance (oil, egg, gum) that holds the pigment in place.
- **Clay**: A source of earth pigments (Ochre).
