Polystyrene is a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer made from the monomer styrene. In construction, it is used in two main forms: Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS). It is a white, rigid foam.

## Description of what it is like

- **EPS (White)**: Composed of small fused beads (like a coffee cup). It is slightly permeable to water vapor.
- **XPS (Colored)**: Usually blue, pink, or green. It has a closed-cell structure, making it smoother, denser, and more water-resistant than EPS.
- Both are extremely light (95-98% air).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic**: Product of the petrochemical industry.
- **Raw Materials**: Petroleum and natural gas.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Polymerization**: Styrene is polymerized into polystyrene beads.
2.  **Expansion (EPS)**: Beads are heated with steam, causing them to expand significantly. They are then molded into blocks.
3.  **Extrusion (XPS)**: Polystyrene crystals are melted with additives and a blowing agent, then extruded through a die into sheets.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Hot Wire Cutter**: The cleanest way to cut it without creating mess (dust/beads).
- **Utility Knife/Saw**: Can be used but creates static-charged crumbs that stick to everything.
- **Adhesive**: Must be solvent-free (water-based or specific foams) as solvents dissolve polystyrene.

### Common forms of use

- **External Wall Insulation (EWI)**: Boards are glued/pinned to the outside of **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** or **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** walls, then rendered with **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**.
- **Insulated Concrete Forms (ICF)**: Hollow blocks of polystyrene that are stacked and filled with **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**.
- **Underfloor Insulation**: Placed under concrete slabs to prevent cold rising from the ground.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Mineral Wool](/en/materials/mineral-wool)**: Fireproof and breathable (better for timber), whereas polystyrene acts as a vapor barrier.
- **[Cork](/en/materials/cork)**: Natural rigid board alternative.
- **[Polyurethane](/en/materials/polyurethane)** (PIR/PUR): Higher insulation value per inch, but more expensive.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Solvents**: Dissolves instantly in contact with acetone, gasoline, or solvent-based glues.
- **UV Light**: Degrades and turns yellow/powdery if left exposed to sunlight for weeks. Must be covered.
- **Flammability**: It melts and burns, producing thick black smoke. Construction grades usually have fire retardants, but it is still combustible.
- **Pests**: Ants and mice love to tunnel through it (easy digging, warm).

### Risks and safety

- **Fire**: Significant fire risk if not enclosed behind plasterboard or concrete.
- **Toxicity**: Burning releases toxic fumes (styrene gas, CO).
- **Environment**: Non-biodegradable and breaks into microplastics.
