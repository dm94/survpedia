Toothpaste or dentifrice is a substance used with a toothbrush to clean dental surfaces. Its main function is to help remove bacterial plaque and food debris through a mild abrasive effect, as well as providing freshness and, in modern versions, fluoride to strengthen enamel.

## Description of what it is like

It can appear as a fine powder or a wet paste. It generally has a very fine gritty texture but is soft to the touch. The color depends on the ingredients (white if chalk/clay, gray if ash, black if charcoal).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Home manufacture or settlements.
- **Signs**: Not natural.
- **Natural/Synthetic**: Synthetic (prepared mixture).

### Minimum processing required

- **Grinding**: Abrasive ingredients (chalk, charcoal, salt) must be ground to an impalpable powder so as not to scratch enamel.
- **Sifting**: Crucial to filter out any large particles.
- **Mixing**: Combine powders with water or oil to form a paste (optional).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mortar and pestle**: To pulverize ingredients.
- **Sieve/Fine cloth**: To ensure powder fineness.
- **Container**: To mix and store.

### Common forms of use

- **Tooth powder**: Wet the brush and dip it into the powder.
- **Paste**: Apply a small amount to the brush.

### Possible substitutes

- **Water only**: Mechanical brushing is the most important part.
- **Fine salt**: Antiseptic and stimulates salivation, but must be used with care.
- **Baking soda**: (If available) Excellent cleaner and acid neutralizer.
- **Activated charcoal**: Absorbs toxins and cleans, but is very messy to use.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Excessive abrasiveness**: If the powder is too coarse, it will sand down dental enamel permanently, causing sensitivity and cavities.
- **Unpleasant taste**: Soap or ash can taste bad; adding herbs (mint, fennel) helps.

### Risks and safety

- **Ingestion**: Should not be swallowed in large quantities, especially if containing soap or strong ash.
- **Preservation**: Wet pastes can breed bacteria/fungi if they don't have preservatives. Powders are safer for long-term storage.

### Related materials

- **Calcium carbonate (Chalk/Eggshell)**: Common abrasive base.
- **Clay (Kaolin)**: Soft base and thickener.
- **Salt**: Preservative and antiseptic.
- **Aromatic herbs**: For flavor and medicinal properties.
