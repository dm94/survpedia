Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. It is famous for its ability to split into thin, flat sheets (fissility).

## Description of what it is like

-   **Appearance:** Typically gray, ranging from pale to dark charcoal, but can also be purple, green, or cyan depending on mineral content. It has a dull to silky luster.
-   **Texture:** Smooth and flat when split.
-   **Hardness:** Hard enough to resist scratching by fingernails, but soft enough to be shaped.

## Origin and where to find it

-   **Origin:** Formed from clay-rich sediments (shale) subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years.
-   **Location:** Found in mountainous regions with a history of tectonic activity (e.g., Wales, Spain, Brazil, Vermont/USA).
-   **Recognition:** Look for rock outcrops that naturally break into flat plates.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Quarrying:** Extract large blocks from the ground (blasting is avoided to prevent shattering).
2.  **Splitting (Riving):** While the rock is still "quarry sap" fresh (containing natural moisture), split the blocks along their natural cleavage planes using a chisel and mallet. It becomes much harder to split once dry.
3.  **Trimming:** Cut the split sheets into desired shapes (rectangles for roofing) using a dressing knife or machine.
4.  **Punching:** Create holes for nails (for roofing).

### Tools needed to work on it

-   **Splitting Chisel (Betel):** A wide, flat chisel used to wedge the layers apart.
-   **Mallet:** For striking the chisel.
-   **Dressing Knife (Zax):** A heavy, blade-like tool with a point for punching holes and an edge for trimming the slate.
-   **Break Iron:** A straight metal edge used as a rest for trimming.

### Common forms of use

-   **Roofing Tiles:** Overlapped to create a watertight, extremely durable roof.
-   **Flooring/Paving:** Durable, non-slip surface.
-   **Writing Slates:** Historically used with chalk for schoolwork.
-   **Billiard Tables:** The bed of the table is made of thick, ground slate for perfect flatness.
-   **Electrical Panels:** Older switchboards used slate because it is an electrical insulator and fireproof.

### Possible substitutes

-   **[Tile](/en/materials/tile) (Ceramic/Concrete):** Cheaper and easier to manufacture, but heavier and less durable.
-   **[Wood](/en/materials/wood) Shingles:** Lighter but flammable and rot-prone.
-   **[Metal](/en/materials/metal):** Lighter, but different aesthetic and thermal properties.
-   **Synthetic Slate:** Rubber or plastic composites (modern).

### Limitations and common failures

-   **Weight:** Slate is very heavy; roof structures must be reinforced.
-   **Brittleness:** Can crack if walked on or impacted by heavy hail.
-   **Nail Sickness:** The iron nails holding the slates may rust and fail long before the slate itself does (copper or stainless steel nails prevent this).
-   **Delamination:** Poor quality slate with high pyrite content can rust and flake over time.

### Risks and safety

-   **Sharp Edges:** Freshly split slate is razor-sharp and can cause deep cuts.
-   **Silica Dust:** Cutting or grinding slate produces respirable silica dust (silicosis risk).
-   **Falling:** Working with heavy materials at height (roofing) carries fall risks.
