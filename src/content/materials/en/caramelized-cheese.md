Caramelized cheese is cheese or pressed curd cooked on a dry hot surface until the surface browns and turns nutty. It is a quick way to turn fresh curd into a crisp, aromatic food that keeps its shape.

## Description of what it is like

The surface is browned and lightly crisp while the interior stays chewy and dense. Flavor shifts toward roasted, savory notes with a hint of sweetness from caramelized milk sugars.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever **[Livestock](/en/knowledge/livestock)** provide milk and a hot stone or pan is available.
- **Signs**: Thin browned slices or flat rounds with a toasted aroma near a hearth.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Curd formation**: Start with fresh curd using acid or **[Enzymes](/en/materials/enzymes)**.
- **Draining and pressing**: Remove whey with **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** and press into a firm slab.
- **Surface drying**: Let the surface dry so it browns instead of melting.
- **Browning**: Cook on a dry hot surface over **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** until caramelized.
- **If skipped**: Without drying and browning it behaves like soft fresh cheese.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Heat**: Even heat from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, stone, or metal surface.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining and pressing.
- **Pressing surface**: Boards of **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or a clean stone.

### Common forms of use

- Thin slices browned as a crisp snack.
- Broken pieces as a topping for soups or stews.
- Warm rounds served with **[Bread](/en/inventions/bread)** or grains.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Bread Cheese](/en/materials/bread-cheese)** for a softer browned crust.
- **[Unripened Cheese](/en/materials/unripened-cheese)** when browning is not possible.
- **[Processed Cheese](/en/materials/processed-cheese)** for short-term melting uses.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Sticking**: Wet surfaces glue to the pan or stone.
- **Burning**: Excess heat blackens the surface before browning.
- **Over-softening**: Too much moisture causes melting instead of crisping.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk or poor sanitation can carry pathogens.
- **Burns**: Hot oil-free surfaces can splatter and scorch skin.
- **Salt load**: Heavy salting may be unsuitable for some diets.
