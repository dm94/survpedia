Honey is a concentrated sugar syrup made by honey bees from flower nectar. It is shelf-stable when kept dry and sealed, making it valuable for food, trade, and preservation.

## Description of what it is like

A thick, sticky liquid that ranges from pale gold to dark amber depending on flowers and season. It smells floral and tastes sweet with distinctive notes.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Flower-rich areas, forest edges, orchards, and meadows.
- **Origin**: Nectar collected by bees and enzymatically converted in the hive.
- **Natural**: Found in honeycombs inside wild colonies or managed hives.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Remove capped honeycomb carefully to avoid crushing brood.
- **Draining**: Let honey drip from combs or press gently.
- **Straining**: Filter through cloth to remove wax and debris.
- **Storage**: Seal in clean, dry **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Knife**: To uncap combs.
- **Cloth**: For filtering.
- **Containers**: For storage and transport.

### Common forms of use

- Raw honey as sweetener and energy source.
- **Fermented drinks** made with **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**.
- Medicinal syrups mixed with herbs.
- Preserving fruit and nuts in honey.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**: Similar sweetness but lacks aroma and enzymes.
- Fruit reductions: Sweet but spoil faster.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture**: Absorbs water and can ferment if stored humid.
- **Crystallization**: Natural and harmless, but changes texture.
- **Contamination**: Dirty tools introduce microbes and off-flavors.

### Risks and safety

- **Infant risk**: Do not feed honey to infants under one year.
- **Stings**: Harvesting requires dealing with bees.

### Related materials

- **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)**: Produced alongside honey.
- **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**: Used for fermentation.
