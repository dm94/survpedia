Steel cable (or wire rope) is a type of rope which consists of several strands of metal wire laid (twisted) into a helix. It is essential for modern heavy lifting and long-span construction.

## Description of what it is like

It looks like a thick, metallic rope. It is heavy, stiff, and extremely strong. Unlike natural fiber ropes, it does not stretch much under load and is resistant to rot and fire.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Manufactured**: It is an industrial product requiring advanced metallurgy.
- **Raw Materials**: High-carbon **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Wire Drawing**: Pulling steel rods through smaller and smaller dies to create thin, strong wires.
2.  **Stranding**: Twisting several wires together to form a strand.
3.  **Closing**: Twisting several strands around a core (fiber or steel) to form the final cable.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Industrial Machinery**: For drawing and twisting.
- **Cutters**: Hydraulic shears or angle grinders to cut it.
- **Clamps/Sockets**: To terminate the ends (knots reduce its strength significantly).

### Common forms of use

- **Running Ropes**: Flexible cables for pulleys and winches.
- **Structural Cables**: Thicker, stiffer cables for bridges (spiral strand or locked coil).

### Possible substitutes

- **[Chain](/en/inventions/chain)**: Heavier, less smooth operation.
- **[Rope](/en/materials/rope)** (Natural/Synthetic): Much weaker, degrades in sunlight/weather.
- **Carbon Fiber**: Modern, lighter, but expensive and brittle.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Corrosion**: Rusts if not galvanized or lubricated.
- **Fatigue**: Repeated bending over pulleys causes wires to break.
- **Kinking**: Once kinked, the wire is permanently damaged.

### Risks and safety

- **Snapback**: If it breaks under tension, it whips with lethal force.
- **Splinters**: Broken wires (fishhooks) can cause severe cuts to hands.
