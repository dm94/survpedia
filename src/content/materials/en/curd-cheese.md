Curd and cheese are concentrated dairy foods made by coagulating milk, draining whey, and stabilizing the curd with salt and aging. They compress fresh milk into a transportable, shelf-stable food with high nutritional density.

## Description of what it is like

Fresh curd is soft, moist, and mild, while cheese ranges from creamy to firm depending on moisture and aging. Aroma and flavor deepen as it ages, shifting from milky and sweet to sharp and savory.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever **[Livestock](/en/knowledge/livestock)** provide milk and clean containers exist.
- **Signs**: Fresh milk, cool storage spaces, and simple heat sources for gentle coagulation.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Coagulation**: Warm milk and add acid or **[Enzymes](/en/materials/enzymes)** to form curds.
- **Draining**: Cut curds and drain whey through **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or a clean strainer.
- **Salting**: Mix or brine with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** to stabilize and flavor.
- **Pressing/Aging**: Press for firmer cheese; age in a cool, clean space for longer storage.
- **If skipped**: Warm storage or low salt leads to rapid spoilage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Heat**: Gentle **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to warm milk without scorching.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining and wrapping.
- **Weights**: Stones or simple presses for firm cheeses.

### Common forms of use

- Fresh curd for immediate meals.
- Soft cheeses for spreads and sauces.
- Hard cheeses for long storage and travel.
- Grated or melted cheese for cooking.

### Possible substitutes

- Dried or salted meats for long storage protein.
- Dried legumes or nuts when animal milk is unavailable.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Spoilage**: Warm temperatures or dirty tools quickly ruin batches.
- **Overheating**: Excess heat makes curd tough and rubbery.
- **Mold**: Unwanted molds grow if aging is too humid or unclean.
- **Salt imbalance**: Too little salt spoils; too much makes it inedible.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk and poor sanitation can carry pathogens.
- **Allergies**: Dairy proteins can trigger reactions.
- **Histamine**: Aged cheeses can affect sensitive people.
