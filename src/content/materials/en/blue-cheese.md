Blue cheese is an aged dairy product in which selected molds create blue-green veins and strong aromas. It concentrates milk into a high-flavor, long-lasting food that stores well when kept cool and humid.

## Description of what it is like

Texture ranges from creamy and spreadable to crumbly and firm depending on moisture and aging. The flavor is salty, sharp, and complex, with a distinctive earthy aroma from the mold.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever milk is available and aging spaces stay cool and humid, such as caves, cellars, or shaded rooms.
- **Signs**: Pierced wheels, blue-green veining, and a pungent aroma during aging.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Curd base**: Make curd from milk using acid or **[Enzymes](/en/materials/enzymes)** and drain.
- **Salting**: Salt the curd to control moisture and inhibit unwanted microbes.
- **Inoculation**: Mix in blue mold culture or introduce spores from **[Fungi](/en/materials/fungi)**.
- **Piercing**: Puncture to allow airflow so the mold can develop.
- **Aging**: Mature in a cool, humid place until flavor and texture stabilize.
- **If skipped**: Poor salting or ventilation leads to spoilage or unwanted mold.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining and wrapping.
- **Piercing tools**: Skewers or thin rods for airflow channels.
- **Aging space**: Cool shelf or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** boards with controlled humidity.

### Common forms of use

- Crumbled as a seasoning for stews and grains.
- Melted into sauces or spreads.
- Eaten as a high-energy travel food in small amounts.

### Possible substitutes

- Aged **[Cheese](/en/materials/cheese)** when blue mold is unavailable.
- Smoked or dried meats for strong flavor and preservation.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Overgrowth**: Excess humidity creates slimy surfaces and bitter flavors.
- **Drying**: Too little humidity cracks the rind and stalls mold.
- **Contamination**: Unclean tools cause off-flavors or spoilage.

### Risks and safety

- **Allergies**: Mold-sensitive people may react to spores.
- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk or poor hygiene can carry pathogens.
- **Histamine**: Strongly aged cheeses can trigger sensitivity.
