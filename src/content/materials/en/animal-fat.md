Animal fat, specifically when rendered as tallow or lard, is a versatile organic material used since antiquity for both energy and lubrication.

## Description of what it is like

It is a greasy, pale substance that is solid or semi-solid at room temperature but melts easily when heated. It has a characteristic odor and is slippery to the touch.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Obtained from any hunted or raised animals.
- Signs: Found in fatty deposits around internal organs or under the skin of animals.
- It is a natural material but requires rendering (heating) to be useful as a pure substance.

### Minimum processing required

- Harvesting: Separating the fatty tissue from the meat and bone.
- Rendering: Melting the fat over low heat to separate it from cellular membranes and water.
- Straining: Removing solid bits (cracklings) to leave pure liquid fat.
- Cooling: Allowing the liquid fat to solidify for storage.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Knives for cutting and scraping.
- Heat source and a pot for rendering.
- Cloth or fine mesh for straining.

### Common forms of use

- Tallow: Hard fat from cattle or sheep, excellent for **[Candles](/en/inventions/candle)**, fuel for **[Oil Lamps](/en/inventions/oil-lamp)** and heavy lubrication.
- Lard: Softer fat from pigs, often used in cooking and fine lubrication.
- Grease: Rendered fat used directly on axles and gears.

### Possible substitutes

- Vegetable Oils: Derived from seeds or fruits (like olive or linseed).
- Mineral Oil: Derived from petroleum (modern).
- Beeswax: For candles or waterproofing, though not as good for lubrication.

### Limitations and common failures

- Rancidity: Decays and smells bad over time if not kept cool or salted.
- Melting point: Becomes too liquid in very hot weather, losing its lubricating effectiveness.
- Pests: Attracts insects and rodents.

### Risks and safety

- Burn hazard: Liquid hot fat can cause severe burns.
- Fire hazard: Highly flammable; can lead to grease fires which are hard to extinguish with water.

### Related materials

- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**: Often treated with fats to keep it supple (part of [Tanning](/en/inventions/tanning)).
- **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**: Produced by reacting fats with an alkali.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: Wooden axles and gears require frequent application of fat.
