Animal fat (Tallow, Lard, Grease) is a lipid obtained from animals. Depending on the source and processing, it can be solid or semi-solid at room temperature. Tallow (beef/mutton fat) is harder, while lard (pork fat) is softer.

## Description of what it is like

Purified animal fat is usually white or yellowish, odorless (if rendered well), and greasy to the touch. It melts into a clear oil when heated.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Anywhere animals are hunted or raised.
- **Signs**: Fatty deposits around organs (kidneys, intestines) and under the skin of animals.
- **It is a natural material**: Found in all animals.

### Minimum processing required

- **Rendering**: Chopping fat into small pieces and heating slowly to melt the liquid fat out of the tissue (cracklings).
- **Straining**: Removing solid bits.
- **Cooling**: Allowing it to solidify.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Knife**: For trimming fat from meat.
- **Pot**: For rendering.
- **Strainer**: For purification.

### Common forms of use

- **Solid**: Rubbed on leather or tools.
- **Melted**: For frying, making soap, or dipping rushlights.

### Possible substitutes

- **Vegetable Oils**: Olive, coconut, or seed oils.
- **Petroleum Jelly**: Modern synthetic alternative for lubrication/protection.
- **Beeswax**: For waterproofing and candles (harder/cleaner burning).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rancidity**: Can spoil if not rendered properly or stored in a cool place, smelling bad.
- **Softness**: Melts easily in hot weather (unlike beeswax).
- **Smell**: Burning fat can produce an acrid odor compared to wax.

### Risks and safety

- **Grease Fire**: Highly flammable when hot; do not use water to extinguish.
- **Burns**: Hot oil causes severe burns.
