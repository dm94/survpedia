Copper is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. It was the first metal to be worked by humans.

## Description of what it is like

Copper has a distinctive reddish-orange metallic luster. It is relatively soft and easy to shape. Over time, it develops a green patina (verdigris) when exposed to air and moisture.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: In veins of volcanic rock; occasionally found as "native copper" nuggets.
- Signs: Green or blue staining on rocks (indicative of copper minerals like malachite or azurite).
- It is a natural element, but usually requires smelting from ore.

### Minimum processing required

- Mining: Extracting copper-bearing ores.
- Crushing: Breaking ore into small pieces.
- Smelting: Heating ore with charcoal to separate the metal from the rock.
- Refining: Purifying the molten metal.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Hammers and anvils for cold-working or forging.
- Crucibles and furnaces for melting.
- Molds for casting.
- Drawing dies for making wire.

### Common forms of use

- Cast: Into tools, ornaments, or vessels.
- Sheet: Hammered out for roofing or cookware.
- Wire: For electrical and decorative purposes.

### Possible substitutes

- Silver/Gold: Better or similar conductors but much more expensive.
- Aluminium: For electrical wiring (lighter but less conductive).
- Plastic: For modern plumbing.

### Limitations and common failures

- Softness: Pure copper is too soft for many heavy-duty tools (better when alloyed).
- Oxidation: Tarnishes and eventually corrodes if not protected.

### Risks and safety

- Toxicity: Ingesting high levels of copper can be toxic (e.g., from acidic food in unlined copper pots).
- Fumes: Smelting can release harmful gases if impurities like arsenic are present.

### Related materials

- Bronze: An alloy of copper and tin.
- Brass: An alloy of copper and zinc.
- Gold: Often found in similar geological contexts.
