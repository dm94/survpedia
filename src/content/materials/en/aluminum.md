Aluminum is a light, silvery metal valued for its strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and excellent conductivity. It is widely used where low mass and durability are critical.

## Description of what it is like

Aluminum has a bright, silvery appearance when freshly cut. It quickly forms a thin oxide layer that protects it from further corrosion. It is soft and easy to shape, but strong when alloyed.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Bauxite deposits in tropical and subtropical laterite soils.
- **Signs**: Reddish, iron-rich soils and layered, clay-like ore.
- **Natural**: Abundant in the crust but not found as native metal; requires processing.

### Minimum processing required

1. **Mining**: Extract bauxite ore.
2. **Refining**: Convert bauxite to alumina (Bayer process).
3. **Smelting**: Reduce alumina to metal by electrolysis (Hall-Héroult).
4. **Casting**: Form ingots, billets, or sheet.

### Tools needed to work on it

- High-temperature furnaces and crucibles
- Large electrical power source for electrolysis
- Molds or rolling equipment for shaping

### Common forms of use

- **Ingots and billets**: For casting or extrusion.
- **Sheet and foil**: Packaging and lightweight panels.
- **Alloys**: Combined with metals like magnesium or copper for strength.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**: Stronger but heavier and more prone to rust.
- **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**: Better conductor but heavier and costlier.
- **[Fiberglass](/en/materials/fiberglass)**: Lightweight but weaker under impact.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Lower melting point**: Softens at temperatures where steel still holds strength.
- **Welding difficulty**: Oxide layer complicates joining.
- **Galvanic corrosion**: Can corrode when paired with dissimilar metals in moisture.

### Risks and safety

- **Molten metal hazards**: High heat causes severe burns.
- **Dust explosion**: Fine aluminum powder is highly flammable.
- **Electrical risk**: Electrolysis requires high current.
