# Description of what it is like

Platinum is a heavy, grey-white metal with a bright luster. It is tough, very resistant to corrosion, and remains stable at high temperatures. It can be worked into sheets and wire but requires intense heat to melt.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Layered mafic or ultramafic intrusions, nickel-copper sulfide deposits, and river placers where heavy grains accumulate.
- **Signs:** Dense metallic grains that resist tarnish; often found with other platinum-group metals.
- **Processing:** Rarely found as pure metal; typically mixed with sulfide ores or alluvial concentrates.

### Minimum processing required

- **Gravity concentration:** For placer sands, washing to collect heavy grains.
- **Smelting:** For sulfide ores, producing a matte that concentrates platinum-group metals.
- **Chemical separation:** Dissolving and precipitating to isolate platinum; low processing leaves brittle, impure metal with weak catalytic performance.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **High-temperature furnace:** Capable of reaching ~1770°C.
- **Crucibles:** Alumina or zirconia that withstand heat and acids.
- **Acid-resistant glassware:** For chemical separation.
- **Hammers and rollers:** For shaping once refined.

### Common forms of use

- **Alloys:** Jewelry and wear-resistant parts.
- **Powder or sponge:** Catalysts for chemical reactions.
- **Wire:** Thermocouples and electrical contacts.
- **Crucibles and labware:** Containers for high-temperature or corrosive work.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)**: Corrosion resistant but softer and lower melting point.
- **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)**: Conductive but tarnishes and softens easily.
- **Stainless steel:** Durable for tools but lacks catalytic properties.
- **Palladium:** Similar catalytic behavior but less heat-resistant.

### Limitations and common failures

- **High melting point:** Difficult to cast without advanced furnaces.
- **Impurity brittleness:** Residual base metals make it crack or flake.
- **Catalyst poisoning:** Sulfur, lead, and oils reduce catalytic activity.
- **Cost and rarity:** Limits large-scale use.

### Risks and safety

- **Hot metal hazards:** High-temperature work risks burns and fire.
- **Fine dust:** Platinum sponge or powder can irritate lungs and skin.
- **Strong acids:** Refining uses corrosive acids that require ventilation and protective gear.
