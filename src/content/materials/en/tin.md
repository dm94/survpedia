Tin is a silvery-white, soft, and malleable metal. It is most famous for its use in making bronze (alloyed with copper) and for its resistance to corrosion.

## Description of what it is like

Tin is a bright, lustrous metal. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife and produces a characteristic "tin cry" (a crackling sound) when bent, caused by the friction of its crystal structure.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Found in alluvial deposits (placer tin) or in primary lodes.
- Signs: Cassiterite is a heavy, dark-colored mineral.
- It is a natural material that requires smelting.

### Minimum processing required

- Washing: Concentrating the heavy cassiterite from river sands.
- Smelting: Heating the concentrate with charcoal in a furnace.
- Refining: Re-melting to separate pure tin from dross.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Furnaces and crucibles.
- Hammers and anvils.
- Molds for alloying.

### Common forms of use

- Bronze: Alloyed with copper (typically 10% tin).
- Pewter: Alloyed with lead or other metals for decorative items.
- Tinplate: Coating iron or steel to prevent rust.

### Possible substitutes

- Zinc: For some coating applications.
- Aluminum: For modern containers and foil.
- Lead: For some low-melting-point alloys, though toxic.

### Limitations and common failures

- Tin Pest: At very low temperatures, tin can transform into a brittle gray form and crumble.
- Low mechanical strength: Cannot be used for heavy loads.

### Risks and safety

- Low toxicity: Pure tin is relatively safe for food contact (hence tin cans).
- Fumes: Avoid inhaling fumes during smelting or soldering.

### Related materials

- Copper: Combined with tin to create bronze.
- Lead: Often alloyed with tin for solder.
- Antimony: Used in alloys like pewter and type metal.
