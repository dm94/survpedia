Rectified spirits are high-purity ethanol produced by repeated or fractional distillation, typically around 95–96% alcohol by volume with the rest being water.

## Description of what it is like

A clear, sharp-smelling liquid that evaporates quickly and mixes readily with water. It burns with a blue flame and dissolves many oils and resins.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Produced wherever fermentation and efficient distillation equipment exist.
- **Signs**: Strong alcohol odor, rapid evaporation, and high flammability.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)**: Create a low-strength alcoholic wash.
- **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)** with reflux or repeated runs: Concentrate ethanol to the azeotropic limit (~95–96%).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **[Still (Alembic)](/en/inventions/alembic)** or column still with a condenser.
- **Thermometer**: To manage cuts and temperature control.
- **Sealed containers**: Glass or metal for safe storage.

### Common forms of use

- **Tinctures and extracts**: Pulls resins, alkaloids, and aromas from plants.
- **Antiseptic**: Diluted to ~70% for best disinfection.
- **Fuel**: Clean-burning alcohol burners and lamps.
- **Cleaning**: Removes grease and dissolves sticky residues.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: Lower concentration but similar chemistry.
- **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**: Cleaning and preservation, less effective as solvent.
- **Vegetable oils**: For fuel and lubrication, but not for antisepsis.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Water absorption**: Readily absorbs moisture, lowering strength.
- **Evaporation losses**: Requires tightly sealed containers.
- **Azeotrope limit**: Simple distillation cannot exceed ~95–96% without special drying.

### Risks and safety

- **Flammability**: Vapors ignite easily; avoid open flames.
- **Toxicity**: Improper distillation can carry methanol; discard foreshots.
- **Inhalation**: Concentrated vapor can irritate and intoxicate.

### Related materials

- **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**: Lower-purity ethanol.
- **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**: Fermentation agent.
- **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**: Fermentable substrate.
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: Dilution and cleaning.
