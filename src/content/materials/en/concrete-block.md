A concrete block (CMU - Concrete Masonry Unit) is a standard-size rectangular block used in building construction. They are usually hollow to reduce weight and allow for steel reinforcement (rebar) and insulation.

## Description of what it is like

- **Appearance:** Grey, rough-textured rectangular block.
- **Structure:** Typically has two or three hollow cores (voids) to reduce weight.
- **Size:** Standard size is often 8x8x16 inches (nominal).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Synthetic:** Manufactured in factories or on-site using molds.
- **Raw Materials:** **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, fine **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel)**, and water.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mixing:** Prepare a "dry" concrete mix (low water content, zero slump) so it holds its shape.
2.  **[Molding](/en/inventions/molding):** Place the mix into a steel or wooden mold.
3.  **Compaction:** Vibrate or ram the mix to remove air pockets and ensure density.
4.  **Demolding:** Remove the mold immediately (if using dry mix machine) or after setting (if using wet mix).
5.  **Curing:** Keep the blocks moist for several days to reach full strength.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Mixer:** To prepare the concrete.
- **Mold:** Essential for shape.
- **Vibration Table:** (Optional but better) To compact the mix.

### Common forms of use

- **Structural Walls:** Stacked in a running bond pattern and joined with **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**.
- **Reinforced Masonry:** Steel bars (rebar) are placed vertically in the hollow cores and filled with grout (fluid concrete) for earthquake/wind resistance.
- **Foundations:** Used for basement walls.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Brick](/en/materials/brick):** Smaller, heavier per volume, usually more expensive.
- **Stone:** Natural alternative.
- **Poured Concrete:** Requires formwork for the entire wall, not just the block.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Weight:** Heavy to lift and place manually all day.
- **Porosity:** Can absorb water if not sealed (needs waterproofing).
- **Cracking:** If the foundation settles, block walls crack in a stair-step pattern.

### Risks and safety

- **Lifting Injury:** Back strain from repetitive heavy lifting.
- **Dust:** Cutting blocks generates silica dust.
