Lead is a dense, soft, silvery-gray metal. It has a very low melting point compared to other metals, making it easy to cast.

## Description of what it is like

Lead is extremely heavy and so soft that it can be scratched with a fingernail. It has a bluish-white luster when freshly cut but quickly tarnishes to a dull gray in the air.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Found in mineral veins, often associated with silver and zinc.
- Signs: Galena, the main ore, appears as shiny, cubic, lead-gray crystals.
- It is a natural material that requires smelting.

### Minimum processing required

- Crushing: Breaking the ore into small pieces.
- Roasting: Heating the ore in air to convert sulfides to oxides.
- Smelting: Reducing the oxide with charcoal in a furnace to produce metallic lead.
- Refining: Removing impurities like silver or copper.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Furnaces and crucibles.
- Molds for casting.
- Hammers and cutting tools.

### Common forms of use

- Cast lead: For weights, bullets, or complex shapes.
- Sheet lead: For roofing or shielding.
- Alloyed lead: Combined with other metals for specific properties.

### Possible substitutes

- Steel or Iron: For weights, though less dense.
- Copper or Plastic: For pipes.
- Tin: For some low-melting-point applications.

### Limitations and common failures

- Low strength: Cannot be used for structural components.
- Creep: Deforms slowly under its own weight over time.
- Corrosion: While resistant to some acids, it can be corroded by soft water.

### Risks and safety

- Toxicity: Lead is a potent neurotoxin. Avoid ingestion and inhalation of dust or fumes.
- Environmental: Persistent pollutant.

### Related materials

- **[White Lead](/en/materials/white-lead)**: A white pigment made from lead.
- **Tin**: Often alloyed with lead to make solder or type metal.
- Antimony: Added to lead to increase its hardness.
- Silver: Often found in the same ores as lead.
