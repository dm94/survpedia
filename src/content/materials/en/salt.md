Salt, specifically table salt, is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride. It is essential for life and has been a highly valued commodity throughout history.

## Description of what it is like

Salt typically appears as white or clear crystals. It has a distinctive sharp, "salty" taste and dissolves readily in water.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Oceans (seawater), salt lakes, and underground salt mines.
- Signs: White crusts on the edges of drying salt lakes; salty taste of water.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Solar Evaporation: Letting seawater dry in shallow ponds.
- Mining: Extracting solid rock salt (halite) from the earth.
- Purification: Dissolving and re-crystallizing to remove impurities.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Evaporation pans or ponds.
- Mining tools (picks, shovels).
- Grinders to produce fine salt.

### Common forms of use

- **Coarse Salt:** For curing (meat, **[hides](/en/knowledge/tanning)**) and industrial use.
- **Fine Salt:** For seasoning.
- **Brine:** Salt dissolved in water for pickling and preservation.

### Possible substitutes

- Other salts (like Potassium Chloride): For diet, though the taste differs.
- Smoke/Drying: For food preservation without salt.

### Limitations and common failures

- Hygroscopy: Absorbs moisture from the air and can become clumpy or dissolve.
- Corrosivity: Accelerates the rusting of metals.

### Risks and safety

- Health: Excessive consumption is linked to high blood pressure.
- Dehydration: Ingesting large amounts of salt without enough water.

### Related materials

- Water: The medium in which salt is often found and dissolved.
- Sodium: One of the constituent elements.
- Chlorine: The other constituent element.
- **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**: Salt is used in the soap-making process to separate soap from glycerin.
