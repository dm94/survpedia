Silver is a precious metal valued for its brightness, conductivity, and resistance to corrosion. It is soft in pure form but can be alloyed for durability.

# Description of what it is like

Silver is a soft, white, lustrous transition metal. It exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. Unlike gold, it tarnishes (oxidizes) when exposed to sulfur in the air, turning black.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments:** Rarely found native. Usually found in ores like Argentite (silver sulfide) or associated with Lead (Galena) and Copper ores.
- **Signs:** Heavy, dark grey ores. Native silver is wiry or mossy.
- **Processing:** Usually requires chemical or thermal separation from other metals.

### Minimum processing required

- **Smelting:** Heating the ore to extract the crude metal.
- **Cupellation:** A critical process to separate silver from lead. Air is blown over the molten alloy in a bone-ash cupel; the lead oxidizes and is absorbed by the cupel, leaving a button of pure silver.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Furnace:** Capable of reaching ~961°C.
- **Crucibles:** For melting.
- **Cupels:** Porous pots made of bone ash for refining.
- **Hammers/Anvils:** For forging.

### Common forms of use

- **Coins:** Historically the standard for daily trade.
- **Silverware:** Utensils and vessels (benefiting from antibacterial properties).
- **Mirrors:** Polished silver reflects 95% of light. It is essential for **[Silver Mirror](/en/inventions/silver-mirror)** manufacturing, where it is chemically deposited onto glass.
- **Solders:** Silver solder is strong and used for joining metals.
- **Electronics:** Due to its superior electrical conductivity.

### Possible substitutes

- **Pewter:** An alloy of tin, looks like silver but is softer and melts at low temps.
- **Aluminium:** Lightweight, conductive, silvery, but harder to refine (requires electricity).
- **Stainless Steel:** Modern substitute for cutlery, does not tarnish.
- **Copper:** For conductivity (worse than silver but cheaper).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Tarnish:** Requires polishing to maintain luster. Sulfur (eggs, volcanic air) turns it black instantly.
- **Softness:** Pure silver is soft; Sterling Silver (92.5% Ag, 7.5% Cu) is standard for durability.

### Risks and safety

- **Argyria:** Ingesting colloidal silver over long periods can turn skin permanently blue-grey.
- **Hot Metal:** Standard foundry risks.
