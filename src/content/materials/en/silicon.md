# Brief description

Silicon is a metalloid and the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen). It is the foundation of modern electronics.

## Properties

-   **Semiconductivity:** Its electrical conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping).
-   **Stability:** Stable at high temperatures.
-   **Abundance:** Extremely common in the form of silica (sand) and silicates.

## Usage

-   **Electronics:** The primary material for transistors, integrated circuits, and microchips.
-   **Energy:** Used in photovoltaic cells for solar panels.
-   **Construction/Industry:** Component of glass, cement, and ceramics.

## Manufacturing/Extraction

1.  **Reduction:** Silica sand (SiO2) is reduced with carbon in an electric arc furnace to produce metallurgical grade silicon.
2.  **Purification:** For electronics, it is further purified (Siemens process) to reach 99.9999999% purity.
3.  **Crystallization:** Melted and drawn into a single crystal (Czochralski process) for wafer production.
