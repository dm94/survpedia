# Brief description

Silicon is a metalloid and the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen). It is the foundation of modern electronics and the digital age. While extremely common in compounds (rocks, sand), pure silicon does not exist in nature and must be extracted.

## Description of what it is like

-   **Appearance:** Dark gray with a metallic luster. Crystalline structure.
-   **Texture:** Very hard but brittle; it shatters rather than bends.
-   **Conductivity:** A semiconductor. Its ability to conduct electricity increases with temperature and can be precisely tuned by "doping" with other elements.

## Origin and where to find it

Silicon is everywhere, but almost always locked in chemical bonds with oxygen.

-   **Sand (Silica/Quartz):** The most common source. Beach sand is often largely silicon dioxide (SiO2).
-   **Quartzite/Rock:** Solid deposits of crystalline silica.
-   **Clays/Soils:** Many silicates are found in common dirt and clay.

### Minimum processing required

Turning sand into a computer chip is one of the most difficult human achievements.

1.  **Reduction (Metallurgical Grade):** Silica (sand) and Carbon (coke/coal) are heated in an Electric Arc Furnace to ~2000°C. The oxygen bonds with carbon, leaving behind silicon (~98% pure).
    -   *Reaction:* SiO2 + 2C → Si + 2CO.
2.  **Purification (Electronic Grade):**
    -   The silicon is reacted with Hydrogen Chloride to form Trichlorosilane (gas).
    -   This gas is distilled to remove impurities.
    -   **Siemens Process:** The gas is decomposed on a hot silicon filament, depositing ultra-pure silicon (99.9999999%).
3.  **Crystallization (Czochralski process):** The pure silicon is melted. A seed crystal is dipped in and slowly pulled out, drawing a single continuous crystal ingot (boule) behind it.

### Tools needed to work on it

-   **Electric Arc Furnace:** Requires massive amounts of electricity.
-   **Chemical Plant:** For handling dangerous gases (HCl, Trichlorosilane) and distillation.
-   **Crystal Puller:** Precision mechanical system with temperature control for growing ingots.
-   **Diamond Saws:** To slice the hard crystal into wafers.

### Common forms of use

-   **Wafer:** Thin slices of single-crystal silicon used as the base for chips.
-   **Polycrystalline:** Used for solar panels (cheaper/easier to make than single crystal, slightly less efficient).
-   **Ferrosilicon:** An alloy of iron and silicon used to deoxidize steel.
-   **Silicone:** A rubber-like polymer made from silicon, used for sealants and medical implants.

### Possible substitutes

-   **Germanium:** The original transistor material. Easier to process (lower melting point) but worse thermal performance.
-   **Gallium Arsenide:** Used for high-speed/frequency electronics, but toxic and rare.
-   **Vacuum Tubes:** The mechanical/glass alternative to silicon chips.
-   **Carbon Nanotubes/Graphene:** Potential future successors, but currently experimental.

### Limitations and common failures

-   **Brittleness:** Wafers are extremely fragile and break easily if dropped or stressed.
-   **Purity Requirements:** Even a single atom of impurity in billions can ruin an electronic chip.
-   **Melting Point:** Melts at 1414°C, requiring specialized crucibles (quartz) to handle the molten material without contaminating it.

### Risks and safety

-   **Silicosis:** Breathing in fine silica dust (from mining or cutting quartz) causes permanent lung damage.
-   **Chemical Hazards:** The purification process uses highly toxic and corrosive chemicals like Hydrochloric Acid and Trichlorosilane.
-   **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF):** Used to etch silicon, it is one of the most dangerous acids known (absorbs through skin, attacks bones).

### Related materials

-   **Glass:** Also made from silica sand, but amorphous (non-crystalline).
-   **Quartz:** The natural crystalline form of Silicon Dioxide.
-   **Germanium:** Its predecessor in electronics.
