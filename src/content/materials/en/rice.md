Rice is a cereal grain cultivated for its calorie-dense seeds. It is a global staple because it stores well when dried and cooks into a filling base food.

## Description of what it is like

Small, hard grains that are pale to golden when dried, with a thin husk and an inner starchy core. When cooked, they swell and become soft and slightly sticky or fluffy depending on variety.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Warm climates with reliable water; lowlands, river valleys, terraces, and flooded fields.
- Signs: Dense green stands with drooping seed heads near maturity and shallow standing water in paddies.
- It is a cultivated crop grown in irrigated or rain-fed fields.

### Minimum processing required

- Drying: Harvested panicles are dried to prevent mold.
- Threshing: Seeds are separated from the stalks.
- Winnowing: Chaff is removed with airflow or baskets.
- Hulling: The husk is removed to make edible rice.
- Milling: Optional polishing, parboiling, or grinding into flour.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Simple threshing tools or feet for treading.
- Cutting tools for harvest and drying racks for airflow.
- Baskets or fans for winnowing.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** for hulling and pounding.
- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for flour.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for dry storage.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for cooking.

### Common forms of use

- Boiled or steamed rice.
- Rice porridge and gruel.
- Ground flour for flatbreads.
- Rice cakes and pressed grains.
- Fermented foods and drinks.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** or **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)** in dry climates.
- **[Potato](/en/materials/potato)** or **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** where grains fail.

### Limitations and common failures

- Water demand: Many varieties need steady moisture.
- Post-harvest losses: Poor drying or ventilation causes spoilage.
- Storage pests: Insects and rodents attack dry grain.
- Breakage: Poor hulling reduces yield and increases waste.

### Risks and safety

- Mold: Damp rice can grow toxins and must be discarded.
- Dust: Milling dust can irritate lungs without ventilation.
- Smoke exposure: Drying over open fires can contaminate grain if uncontrolled.

### Related materials

- **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**: Rice straw is used for thatching and bedding.
- **[Water](/en/materials/water)**: Essential for cultivation and cooking.
- **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**: Common for cooking and preservation.
- **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)**: Used in rice-based fermentations.
