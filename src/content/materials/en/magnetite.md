Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores. It is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth.

## Physical Description

Magnetite is black or brownish-black with a metallic luster. It is heavy and hard. Pieces that are naturally magnetized are called **Lodestones**. These were the first permanent magnets discovered by humans.

## Origin and Where to Find It

-   **Environments**: Found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Common in black sand beaches.
-   **Signs**: Heavy black rocks. Can be found using a magnet on a string (it will stick).
-   **Natural Material**: It is mined directly.

### Minimum Processing Required

-   **Collection**: Picking up lodestones or mining the ore.
-   **Shaping**: Can be ground into a shape (like a spoon) for a primitive compass, though it is brittle.

### Tools Needed to Work It

-   **Hammer/Pick**: For extraction.
-   **Grinding stones**: For shaping.

### Common Forms of Use

-   **Lodestone**: Used directly for magnetizing needles or as a primitive compass.
-   **Iron Ore**: Smelted to produce iron.

### Possible Substitutes

-   **Artificial Magnets**: Created using electricity (electromagnets).
-   **Steel**: Can be magnetized, but requires an initial magnetic source (like magnetite) or electricity.

### Limitations and Common Failures

-   **Loss of Magnetism**: Can lose magnetism if heated to high temperatures (Curie point) or struck violently.
-   **Brittleness**: Like most rocks, it will shatter if hit hard.

### Risks and Safety

-   **Heavy**: Large rocks can cause injury if dropped.
-   **Safe**: Generally non-toxic.

### Related Materials

-   **Iron**: The metal extracted from magnetite.
-   **Compass**: The primary invention enabled by lodestone.
