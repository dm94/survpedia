Simple acids, specifically concentrated acetic acid (often called "Strong Vinegar" or "Spirit of Vinegar"), are a step up from household vinegar. While normal vinegar is 5-8% acid, strong vinegar can reach much higher concentrations, making it useful for chemical reactions that weak vinegar cannot sustain.

## Description of what it is like

A clear, colorless liquid with an overpowering, suffocating smell of vinegar. In very high concentrations (glacial acetic acid), it can freeze into ice-like crystals at cool room temperatures. It is corrosive to skin and many metals.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Not natural**: Does not occur naturally in high concentrations.
- **Source**: Produced by processing standard vinegar.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Fractional Freezing (Jack separation)**:
    - Freeze a container of vinegar. Water freezes before acetic acid.
    - Discard the ice (which is mostly water).
    - The remaining liquid is concentrated acid.
    - Repeat multiple times to increase concentration.
2.  **Distillation**:
    - Distill vinegar, but be careful as water and acetic acid have close boiling points. The first fraction is often water-rich.
    - Distilling metal acetates (like copper acetate) can yield very pure acid (historical method).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Freezing container**: For the freeze method (clay, wood, or metal that resists acid).
- **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)** apparatus: For the heat method (glass or ceramic retort).
- **Storage bottles**: Glass or ceramic with tight seals.

### Common forms of use

- **Solvent**: Dissolving [Copper](/en/materials/copper) to make [Verdigris](/en/materials/verdigris) (pigment) or [Lead](/en/materials/lead) to make [White Lead](/en/materials/white-lead) (pigment).
- **Cleaning**: Removing heavy rust or scale.
- **Medicine**: Cauterizing wounds (historical).

### Possible substitutes

- **[Sulfuric Acid](/en/materials/sulfuric-acid)**: Much stronger, but harder to make.
- **Citric Acid (concentrated)**: Lemon juice boiled down.
- **Formic Acid**: From distilling ants (historical).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Hygroscopic**: Concentrated acid absorbs water from the air, weakening itself.
- **Freezing**: High concentrations freeze at ~16°C (62°F).

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical Burns**: Can cause severe skin burns and eye damage.
- **Vapors**: Inhaling vapors can damage lungs. Work in a ventilated area.
- **Corrosion**: Will destroy corks and some metals rapidly.

### Related materials

- **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**: The raw material.
- **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**: Reacts to form Verdigris.
- **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**: Reacts to form Sugar of Lead.
