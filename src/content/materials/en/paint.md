Paint is a colored substance that is spread over a surface and dries to leave a thin decorative or protective coating. It consists of three main components: pigment (color), binder (glue), and solvent (thinner).

## Description of what it is like

Paint is typically a viscous liquid or paste. Its color and opacity depend on the pigment used. Upon drying, it forms a solid film that adheres to the substrate. The texture can range from matte to high gloss depending on the binder-to-pigment ratio.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Pigment**: Sourced from minerals, plants, or soot (see [Pigments](/en/materials/pigments)).
- **Binder**:
  - **Natural**: Egg yolk (Tempera), Gum Arabic (Watercolor), Animal Glue (Distemper), Linseed/Walnut Oil (Oil Paint), Casein (Milk Paint).
  - **Synthetic**: Acrylics, Alkyds.
- **Solvent**: Water, Turpentine, Mineral Spirits.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Pigment Preparation**: Grinding pigment into fine powder.
2.  **Binder Preparation**: Separating egg yolk, dissolving gum, or refining oil.
3.  **Mixing**: Thoroughly mixing the pigment and binder. This often requires grinding them together (mulling) to ensure every pigment particle is coated with binder.
4.  **Thinning**: Adding solvent to reach brushable consistency.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Muller and Slab**: For grinding pigment into binder.
- **Palette**: For holding and mixing paints.
- **Containers**: For storage (tubes, jars, bladders).
- **Brushes/Spatulas**: For application.

### Common forms of use

- **Oil Paint**: Pigment + Drying Oil. Slow drying, durable, flexible.
- **Tempera**: Pigment + Egg Yolk. Fast drying, brittle, permanent.
- **Watercolor**: Pigment + Gum Arabic. Transparent, water-soluble.
- **Fresco**: Pigment + Water (applied to wet lime plaster).

### Possible substitutes

- **Stains/Dyes**: Penetrate the surface rather than sitting on top.
- **Colored Clay/Mud**: Primitive body paint or temporary wall covering.
- **Blood/Berry Juice**: Makeshift paints, though often fugitive.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Cracking**: If applied too thickly or if flexible layers are painted over brittle ones (fat over lean rule).
- **Peeling**: Poor adhesion to the surface (surface needs priming).
- **Fading**: UV exposure degrading the pigment.
- **Yellowing**: Oil binders can yellow over time in the dark.

### Risks and safety

- **Flammability**: Solvents like turpentine are highly flammable.
- **Toxicity**: Solvents can cause respiratory issues. Pigments can be toxic if ingested or inhaled.
- **Spontaneous Combustion**: Rags soaked in drying oils (linseed) can self-ignite as they oxidize.
