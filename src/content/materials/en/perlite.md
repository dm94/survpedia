Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content. It is a naturally occurring mineral that exists as a type of obsidian. When heated, it expands greatly.

## Description of what it is like

- **Raw:** Black or gray dense glass (obsidian-like).
- **Expanded:** White, ultra-lightweight granules that look like styrofoam beads but are made of stone. They crumble into powder if crushed hard.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural:** Volcanic regions.
- **Mining:** Extracted from open-pit mines.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Mining:** Extraction of the ore.
2.  **Crushing/Grading:** Breaking down to consistent size.
3.  **Expansion:** Heating rapidly to 850-900°C. The water trapped in the structure vaporizes and expands the rock (like popcorn).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Kiln/Furnace:** For expansion.
- **Mixer:** For combining with cement or soil.
- **Mask:** Dust mask is essential as the fine powder is irritating.

### Common forms of use

- **Insulating Concrete:** Mixed with **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)** (instead of sand/gravel) to create lightweight, insulating concrete for roof decks or chimney linings.
- **Horticulture:** Mixed with soil to improve aeration and drainage (the white specks in potting soil).
- **Loose-fill:** Poured into hollow block cores for insulation.

### Possible substitutes

- **Vermiculite:** Similar expanded mineral (mica-based), holds more water.
- **Polystyrene beads:** For lightweight concrete (but flammable).
- **Pumice:** Natural expanded volcanic rock (heavier than perlite).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Crushing:** Granules break down easily under heavy weight; not for structural load-bearing concrete.
- **Water Absorption:** Can hold water, which is good for plants but bad for insulation if it freezes.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** Nuisance dust. While not carcinogenic like asbestos, inhaling any mineral dust is bad for lungs.
- **Silica:** Contains some crystalline silica.
