Gypsum is a mineral material that, after being heated and dehydrated, becomes a powder that quickly recovers its original solid form when mixed with water. It is one of the oldest binders used by humans.

## Description of what it is like

- **Natural Mineral:** Soft, crystalline rock, white, gray, or pink in color.
- **Processed Gypsum:** Very fine white powder (Plaster of Paris).
- **Set Mixture:** White solid, smooth to the touch, but relatively soft (can be scratched with a fingernail).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural Deposits:** Found abundantly in sedimentary layers of the earth's crust, often associated with saline rocks.
- **Appearance:** Can appear as "alabaster" (white and translucent), "selenite" (transparent crystals), or granular rock masses.

### Minimum processing required

It is much easier to produce than lime or cement because it requires lower temperature.

1.  **Extraction:** Extract gypsum stone (alabaster) from the quarry.
2.  **Crushing:** Break the stone into small pieces.
3.  **Cooking:** Heat the crushed stone at low temperature (between 100°C and 150°C). This removes part of the water from its crystal structure.
    - *Note:* If heated too much (>200°C), it loses its ability to set (dead-burnt gypsum).
4.  **Grinding:** Grind the cooked product into a fine powder.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Simple Kiln:** Even a controlled bonfire can work if care is taken with the temperature.
- **Mortar or Mill:** To pulverize the cooked stone.
- **Trough and Trowel:** To mix with water and apply.

### Common forms of use

- **Black Plaster:** Less pure, used for the first coat on walls.
- **White Plaster:** More pure and fine, for the final finish.
- **Stucco:** Mixture of gypsum with animal glue or resins for decorative finishes (artificial marble).

### Possible substitutes

- **Lime:** More resistant to moisture and harder, but takes longer to set.
- **Mud/Clay:** For rustic coatings.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Moisture (Main Enemy):** Gypsum is slightly soluble in water and loses its strength if it gets wet. It should not be used outdoors exposed to rain or in very humid areas.
- **Corrosion:** Wet gypsum corrodes iron and steel (must not be in direct contact with unprotected metal reinforcement).
- **Very Rapid Setting:** Hardens in minutes, forcing small batches to be prepared and worked quickly.

### Risks and safety

- **Dust:** Inhalation of dust during grinding or sanding.
- **Burns:** Although cooked at low temperature, the process involves heat.
