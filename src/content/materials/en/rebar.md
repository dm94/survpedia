Short for **reinforcing bar**. A steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in **[Reinforced Concrete](/en/materials/reinforced-concrete)** and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and aid the concrete under tension.

## Description of what it is like

It is a long, cylindrical rod of steel, usually with a patterned surface (ridges or ribs) to help it bond better with concrete. It is heavy, strong, and can be bent into specific shapes.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Artificial:** Manufactured in steel mills.
- **Scrap:** Can often be found in demolished concrete structures (needs cleaning).

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Cutting:** To length using bolt cutters, saws, or torches.
2.  **Bending:** To form corners, hooks, or stirrups.
3.  **Tying:** Wired together to form a cage before concrete is poured.
4.  **Cleaning:** Must be free of loose rust, oil, or mud to bond with concrete.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Bolt Cutters:** For thinner bars.
- **Angle Grinder / Saw:** For thicker bars.
- **Rebar Bender:** Manual or hydraulic tool to bend bars precisely.
- **Pliers:** To twist wire ties.

### Common forms of use

- **Straight Bars:** For beams and columns.
- **Mesh:** Welded wire fabric for slabs and walls.
- **Stirrups:** Rectangular loops to hold main bars in place.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Bamboo](/en/materials/bamboo):** Can be used in low-load, temporary structures (rots over time).
- **Fiberglass Rebar:** Non-corrosive, but brittle and cannot be bent on site.
- **Wire Mesh:** For light loads like sidewalks.
- **Scrap Iron:** Old pipes or bed frames (unreliable strength).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Corrosion:** Rusts quickly if exposed to moisture; expanding rust cracks concrete.
- **Bond Failure:** Smooth bars (no ridges) can slip out of concrete.

### Risks and safety

- **Impacement:** Exposed vertical bars are dangerous if someone falls on them (use caps).
- **Cuts:** Sharp ends and burrs.
- **Back Injury:** Heavy to lift and carry.
