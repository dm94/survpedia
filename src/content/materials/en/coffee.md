Coffee is made from roasted seeds of the coffee plant. It is brewed with hot or cold water to produce a dark, aromatic drink with a strong stimulant effect.

## Description of what it is like

Raw beans are pale green and hard. After roasting they become dark brown, oily, and highly aromatic. When brewed, coffee produces a bitter, rich liquid with a strong scent.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Tropical or subtropical highlands with regular rainfall and shade.
- Signs: Shrubs or small trees with glossy leaves and red or yellow cherries.
- It is a cultivated crop that can be grown in managed plots or forest gardens.

### Minimum processing required

- Depulping: Remove the fruit from the cherries.
- Fermentation/Washing: Clean the beans if using wet processing.
- Drying: Reduce moisture until beans are stable for storage.
- Hulling: Remove the parchment layer.
- Roasting: Heat to develop flavor and aroma.
- Grinding: Crush into a coarse or fine powder before brewing.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Drying racks or clean mats for drying.
- A pan or drum over **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for roasting.
- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or mortar for grinding.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage and transport.

### Common forms of use

- Brewed coffee from ground beans.
- Cold brew steeped for many hours.
- Concentrated decoction mixed with **[Water](/en/materials/water)**.
- Sweetened drinks with **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Tea](/en/materials/tea)** for a milder caffeine source.
- Roasted grains or roots for caffeine-free drinks.

### Limitations and common failures

- Staling: Ground coffee loses aroma quickly when exposed to air.
- Over-roasting: Creates burnt, bitter flavors.
- Moisture damage: Damp beans mold and become unsafe.

### Risks and safety

- Caffeine sensitivity: Can cause jitters or insomnia.
- Burns: Hot liquid can scald.
- Contamination: Dirty grinders or filters taint flavor and safety.
