Bread cheese is a firm, fresh cheese cooked until the surface browns and the interior stays springy. It is often eaten warm, retaining a squeaky bite and a toasted aroma.

## Description of what it is like

It has a browned, dry crust and a dense, moist interior that resists melting. The texture is springy and squeaks against the teeth, with a mild, milky flavor and roasted notes from the heat.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Made wherever **[Livestock](/en/knowledge/livestock)** provide milk and there is a hot surface for baking or pan-roasting.
- **Signs**: Flat cheese rounds, browned surfaces, and the smell of warm dairy near a hearth.
- **It is a processed material.**

### Minimum processing required

- **Curd formation**: Start with fresh curd using acid or **[Enzymes](/en/materials/enzymes)**.
- **Draining and pressing**: Remove whey with **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** and press into a firm wheel.
- **Salting**: Salt the surface or use a light brine with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**.
- **Browning**: Bake or pan-roast over **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** to form a toasted crust.
- **If skipped**: Without browning it behaves like a soft fresh cheese and spoils faster.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Vessels**: Clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots.
- **Heat**: Even heat from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, stone, or metal surface.
- **Cloth**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** for draining and pressing.
- **Pressing surface**: Boards of **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or a clean stone.

### Common forms of use

- Sliced and warmed as a hearty snack.
- Pan-roasted pieces served with **[Bread](/en/inventions/bread)** or grains.
- Cubed into soups or stews where it keeps its shape.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Unripened Cheese](/en/materials/unripened-cheese)** when browning is not possible.
- **[Cheese](/en/materials/cheese)** for longer storage but different melt behavior.
- **[Tofu](/en/materials/tofu)** for a non-dairy, heat-stable alternative.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Scorching**: High heat burns the surface before the interior warms.
- **Drying**: Overbaking makes it tough and crumbly.
- **Cracking**: Insufficient pressing causes splits during heating.

### Risks and safety

- **Foodborne illness**: Raw milk or poor sanitation can carry pathogens.
- **Allergies**: Dairy proteins can trigger reactions.
- **Salt load**: Heavy salting may be unsuitable for some diets.
