Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, usually with 12–12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals. It was the first alloy to be used by humans on a large scale.

## Description of what it is like

Bronze has a distinctive brownish-gold color. It is harder than pure copper and much more resistant to corrosion, especially from seawater. Over time, it develops a green protective layer called a patina.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Does not occur naturally. It must be created by alloying copper and tin.
- Signs: Found in archaeological sites or specialized industrial production areas.
- It is a synthetic alloy.

### Minimum processing required

- Smelting: Extracting copper and tin from their respective ores.
- Mixing: Combining the molten metals in the correct proportions.
- Casting: Pouring the molten alloy into molds to create shapes.
- Work-hardening: Hammering the finished object to increase its hardness.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Furnaces capable of reaching over 1000°C.
- Crucibles for melting the metal.
- Molds made of stone, clay, or sand.
- Hammer and anvil for finishing.

### Common forms of use

- Cast Bronze: Poured into molds for complex shapes like statues or gears.
- Wrought Bronze: Hammered into shape for tools and weapons.
- Phosphor Bronze: Modern version with added phosphorus for increased strength and low friction.

### Possible substitutes

- Copper: Softer and less durable.
- Steel: Much stronger and cheaper for modern use, but harder to produce in antiquity.
- Brass: An alloy of copper and zinc, often used for decorative purposes.

### Limitations and common failures

- Brittleness: If the tin content is too high, the bronze can become brittle and snap.
- Cost: Tin is historically rare and expensive to obtain.
- Wear: While hard, it is still softer than steel and will wear down over long periods of use.

### Risks and safety

- Fumes: Smelting and alloying can release toxic fumes if impurities like arsenic are present.
- Molten Metal: Severe burn hazard during casting.

### Related materials

- Copper: The main ingredient.
- Tin: The essential alloying element.
- Brass: Another copper alloy (using zinc instead of tin).
