Mortar is a plastic mixture that hardens over time, used in construction to join bricks, stones, or concrete blocks, and to fill the spaces between them. It is also used to coat walls.

## Description of what it is like

In its fresh state, it is a grayish or sandy paste, moldable and sticky. Upon hardening, it becomes a solid and rigid material, similar to artificial stone, although generally less resistant than the materials it joins.

## Origin and where to find it

It is a composite material manufactured in situ.

- **Sand:** Must be clean and free of organic matter or salt.
- **Binder:** Can be lime, clay (mud), gypsum, or cement.
- **Water:** Clean.

### Minimum processing required

1.  **Sieving:** Sand must be sieved to remove large stones.
2.  **Slaking (if using lime):** Quicklime must be carefully hydrated before use.
3.  **Mixing:** Mix the binder and sand dry until the color is uniform.
4.  **Hydration:** Add water gradually and mix until a workable consistency is obtained (neither too liquid nor too dry).

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Trough or wheelbarrow:** To perform the mixing.
- **Hoe or shovel:** To mix.
- **Trowel:** To apply and spread the mortar on bricks or walls.

### Common forms of use

- **Mud mortar:** Clay + Sand + Straw. The oldest and easiest to make, but vulnerable to water.
- **Lime mortar:** Lime + Sand + Water. Resistant, breathable, and flexible. It "self-heals" over time.
- **Cement mortar:** Cement + Sand + Water. Very hard and resistant, waterproof, but rigid (can crack if the building moves).
- **Bastard mortar:** Mixture of lime and cement to combine properties.

### Possible substitutes

- **Simple mud:** For temporary constructions or in very dry climates.
- **Gypsum:** For interiors (does not withstand moisture).
- **Bitumen/Asphalt:** Used anciently in Mesopotamia to waterproof and join bricks.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Rapid drying:** If it dries too fast (in direct sun), it cracks and loses strength. It must be kept moist during curing.
- **Incorrect proportion:** Too much sand makes it crumble; too much binder makes it shrink and crack.
- **Incompatibility:** Using cement mortar (very hard) in old soft brick or stone buildings can damage the bricks (the mortar should always be softer than the brick).

### Risks and safety

- **Chemical burns:** Lime and cement are alkaline and can burn skin and eyes. Use gloves.
- **Dust:** Inhaling lime or silica (sand) dust is dangerous.
