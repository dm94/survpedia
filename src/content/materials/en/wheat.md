Wheat is a cereal grain valued for its high yields and gluten, which allows dough to rise and form stable breads.

## Description of what it is like

Hard, oval grains with a pale golden color. When milled it becomes a fine flour that forms elastic dough with water.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Temperate fields with moderate rainfall.
- Signs: Upright stalks topped by seed heads that turn golden at maturity.
- It is a cultivated crop grown in open fields.

### Minimum processing required

- Drying: Heads are dried to reduce moisture.
- Threshing: Grain is separated from the stalks.
- Winnowing: Chaff is removed by airflow or tossing.
- Milling: Grain is ground into flour.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Cutting tools for harvest.
- **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** for grinding.
- **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.
- **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for baking and cooking.

### Common forms of use

- Flour for bread and flatbreads.
- Boiled grain or porridge.
- Fermented foods and drinks.

### Possible substitutes

- **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)** or **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)** as alternative grains.
- **[Potato](/en/materials/potato)** or **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** when grain yields fail.

### Limitations and common failures

- Moisture damage: Damp grain molds quickly.
- Milling dependence: Many uses require grinding tools.
- Gluten sensitivity: Not suitable for all diets.

### Risks and safety

- Mold toxins: Spoiled grain can be dangerous if eaten.
- Flour dust: Fine dust can irritate eyes and lungs.
