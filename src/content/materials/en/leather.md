Leather is a durable and flexible material created by tanning animal rawhide and skins. The most common raw material is cattle hide.

## Description of what it is like

Leather is tough yet pliable. It has a characteristic smell and a natural texture. It can be dyed, embossed, and polished.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Anywhere livestock or wild animals are found.
- Signs: It is obtained from the skin of mammals, reptiles, or birds.
- It is a processed material derived from natural sources.

### Minimum processing required

- Skinning: Removing the hide from the animal.
- Cleaning: Removing meat, fat, and hair.
- [Tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning): Treating with tannins (from bark, etc.) or minerals to stop decay and keep it flexible.
- Finishing: Oiling, dyeing, or polishing.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Scraping tools for cleaning the hide.
- Tanning vats or containers.
- Awls and needles for sewing.
- Knives for cutting.

### Common forms of use

- Rawhide: Untanned, very stiff when dry (used for drums or bindings).
- Tanned Leather: Flexible and durable for garments.
- Suede: Leather with a napped finish.

### Possible substitutes

- Synthetic Leather (Vinyl/PU): Modern alternatives.
- Heavy Textiles: Canvas or denim.
- Plant Fibers: Like flax or hemp for some applications.

### Limitations and common failures

- Mold: Can rot or mold if kept in damp, unventilated conditions.
- Drying: Can become brittle if it loses its natural oils.
- Stretching: Can lose its shape over time under tension.

### Risks and safety

- Biological hazards: Raw hides can carry bacteria and parasites.
- Chemical hazards: Traditional tanning can involve harsh substances (though plant tannins are safer).

### Related materials

- Wool: Often comes from the same animals.
- Bone: Another animal byproduct.
- Plant Fibers: Used for sewing leather pieces together.
