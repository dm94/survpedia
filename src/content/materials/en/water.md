Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is vital for all known forms of life.

## Description of what it is like

In its liquid state, water flows and takes the shape of its container. It can also exist as a solid (ice) and a gas (vapor/steam).

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Oceans, rivers, lakes, underground aquifers, and glaciers.
- Signs: Visible bodies of water; damp soil; clouds.
- It is a natural material.

### Minimum processing required

- Collection: From a source.
- Filtration: Removing physical impurities and sediment.
- Purification/Disinfection: Boiling or chemical treatment to kill pathogens.
- Distillation: For high purity.

### Tools needed to work on it

- Buckets and containers for transport and storage.
- Filters (sand, charcoal, cloth).
- Heat source for boiling.
- Pumps for extraction.

### Common forms of use

- Raw: For washing and basic cooling.
- Purified: For drinking and cooking.
- Steam: For power generation and sterilization.

### Possible substitutes

- None for biological consumption.
- Other liquids (like oils or alcohols) for specific industrial or solvent uses.

### Limitations and common failures

- Contamination: Easily polluted by chemicals or biological agents.
- Freezing: Expands when frozen, which can burst pipes or containers.
- Evaporation: Lost to the atmosphere if not contained.

### Risks and safety

- Drowning: In large bodies of water.
- Pathogens: Waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid, etc.).
- Scalding: From hot water or steam.

### Related materials

- Ice: The solid form of water.
- Salt: Often found dissolved in water (seawater).
- Clay: Becomes malleable when mixed with water.
- Soap: Works with water to clean.
