A black or dark brown non-crystalline soil or viscous material, composed principally of high molecular weight hydrocarbons.

## Description of what it is like

It is a sticky, black, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. At room temperature, it can be solid and brittle, but when heated, it flows like a thick liquid. It is hydrophobic (repels water) and adhesive.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Natural Seeps:** It seeps from the ground in certain areas (e.g., La Brea Tar Pits, Pitch Lake in Trinidad).
- **Bituminous Rock:** Sandstone or limestone impregnated with bitumen.
- **Refined:** Produced by the distillation of crude oil (the heavy fraction left behind).

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection:** Gathering from seeps or mining bituminous rock.
- **Purification:** Heating to melt it and separate it from impurities like sand and water (decanting).
- **Distillation (Advanced):** Heating crude oil to remove lighter fractions (gasoline, kerosene) leaving bitumen.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Containers:** Pots or cauldrons for heating (must withstand heat).
- **Heat Source:** Fire to melt it.
- **Applicators:** Brushes or sticks to apply it hot.

### Common forms of use

- **Hot Melt:** Applied while hot and liquid to waterproof surfaces or glue items.
- **Mixed with Aggregate:** Mixed with sand and gravel to make asphalt concrete.

### Possible substitutes

- **Pine Tar/Resin:** For waterproofing and adhesion (from trees).
- **Clay:** For sealing (but not waterproof in the long term without firing).
- **Wax:** For waterproofing (less durable).

### Limitations and common failures

- **Temperature Sensitivity:** Can become brittle in extreme cold and too soft/flowing in extreme heat.
- **UV Degradation:** Breaks down over time under direct sunlight (cracking).

### Risks and safety

- **Burns:** Working with hot bitumen carries a high risk of severe burns.
- **Fumes:** Heating it releases fumes that can be irritating or toxic in enclosed spaces.
- **Flammability:** It is flammable, especially when overheated.

### Related materials

- **Asphalt:** Often refers to the mixture of bitumen and aggregate.
- **Tar:** Produced from coal or wood, distinct from bitumen (petroleum-based).
