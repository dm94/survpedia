Iron is a lustrous, silvery-soft metal. It is the most common element on Earth by mass, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.

## Description of what it is like

Freshly polished iron is silvery-grey. It is heavy and very strong. It is magnetic and will quickly rust (red-brown) when exposed to moist air.

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments: Found in many minerals (ores) in the Earth's crust; also found in some meteorites.
- Signs: Reddish or yellowish soil (rust color); heavy, dark rocks that affect a compass needle.
- It is a natural element, but requires high heat to extract from ore.

### Minimum processing required

- Smelting: Heating iron ore with charcoal or coke at very high temperatures.
- Bloomery/Blast Furnace: To separate the iron from the slag.
- Forging: Hammering the hot metal to remove impurities and shape it.

### Tools needed to work on it

- High-temperature furnaces (capable of reaching 1200°C+).
- Bellows for air supply.
- Heavy anvils and hammers.
- Tongs for handling hot metal.

### Common forms of use

- Wrought Iron: Tough, malleable iron with low carbon content.
- Cast Iron: Hard, brittle iron with high carbon content.
- Steel: Iron alloyed with a small amount of carbon for superior strength.

### Possible substitutes

- Bronze: Used before the technology to smelt iron was developed.
- Steel: The modern and superior version of iron.
- Aluminium or Composites: For lightweight strength.

### Limitations and common failures

- Corrosion: Iron rusts easily, which can lead to structural failure.
- Brittleness: Cast iron can shatter under impact.
- High Melting Point: Difficult to work with compared to copper or gold.

### Risks and safety

- Extreme Heat: Risk of severe burns during smelting and forging.
- Heavy Loads: Physical injury from handling heavy ingots or tools.
- Sparks: Eye and skin protection is essential.

### Related materials

- Steel: The most important alloy of iron.
- Charcoal: Essential for the traditional smelting of iron.
- Magnetite: A common and magnetic iron ore.
