Description of the material.

## Description of what it is like

Description...

## Origin and where to find it

- Environments where it appears (rivers, mountains, forests, coasts, etc.)
- Visual or physical signs to recognize it
- Whether it is natural or requires transformation

Example: clay → fine soils, near water, plastic when moistened.

### Minimum processing required

Before using it, what needs to be done?

- Drying
- Grinding
- Melting
- Cooking
- Fermentation
- Purification

And what happens if it is not processed properly?

### Tools needed to work on it

- Basic tools
- Required technological level
- Primitive alternatives

### Common forms of use

- Raw
- Processed
- Combined with other materials

This helps to understand why it is used in this way and not in another.

### Possible substitutes

One of the most valuable points of the codex.

- Alternative materials
- What is lost when replacing it
- In which cases the substitute is not suitable

This gives resilience to knowledge.

### Limitations and common failures

- What degrades it (water, fire, sun, weather)
- Common mistakes when using it
- Signs of structural failure

### Risks and safety

- Toxicity
- Physical hazards
- Gases, cuts, collapses

### Related materials

- Other materials that are similar in properties or uses
- How they differ from each other
- Common misconceptions about them
- Materials that often appear together
