# Brief description

What the invention is, without history or epic.
What it does
What it allows you to achieve

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose must be clear:

- Primary use
- Secondary uses
- Scale (domestic, industrial, local, mass)

## Operating principle

Very important, but without unnecessary mathematics:

- What physical/chemical/logical phenomenon is exploited?
- What happens step by step at a conceptual level?

Example: rotation → magnetic field → current.

## How to create it

- Not “how a company manufactures it,” but rather:
- Minimum functional version
- What is essential and what is optional
- What technical level is required (basic/intermediate/advanced)

## Materials needed

Clearly separated:

- Essential materials
- Tools
- Possible substitutes

This is key to ensuring that knowledge does not depend on a single modern technology.

## Variants and improvements

- Early versions
- Modern versions
- What is improved (efficiency, size, cost)

## Limits and risks

Very important if it is a serious codex:

- What it cannot do
- Physical, chemical, or social risks
- What can go wrong when building it
