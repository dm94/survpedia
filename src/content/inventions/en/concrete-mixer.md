# Brief description

A concrete mixer is a device that homogeneously combines **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**, aggregate such as **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** or **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel)**, and water to form **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**. A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components.

## Use / Function

-   **Mixing:** Ensuring that the cement paste evenly coats every piece of aggregate for maximum strength.
-   **Efficiency:** Much faster and less labor-intensive than hand mixing with a shovel.
-   **Quality:** Prevents "segregation" (separation of large stones from the paste) and dry pockets.

## Operating principle

The mixer usually consists of a drum with internal blades or paddles. As the drum rotates, the blades lift the heavy wet mix and drop it back down (folding action), ensuring thorough mixing. The drum is often tilted to assist in mixing and can be tipped further to discharge the concrete.

## How to create it

1.  **Drum:** Construct a barrel or cone shape from steel sheet or wood staves.
2.  **Blades:** Bolt or weld metal paddles inside the drum at an angle to force the material to tumble.
3.  **Axis:** Mount the drum on a tilted axis with sturdy bearings.
4.  **Frame:** Build a strong A-frame to support the heavy rotating load.
5.  **Drive:** Attach a large gear or pulley to the drum and connect it to a hand crank or motor (gas/electric).

## Materials needed

-   **Structure:** Steel, iron, or wood.
-   **Bearings:** To support the rotation.
-   **Power Source:** Human muscle (crank), animal, or engine.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Hand Mixer:** A simple barrel on a stand turned by hand.
-   **Pan Mixer:** A stationary pan with rotating paddles (vertical axis), better for dry or stiff mixes.
-   **Twin-Shaft Mixer:** Industrial mixer with two horizontal shafts for high-volume production.
-   **Transit Mixer:** The familiar truck-mounted mixer that mixes while transporting.

## Limits and risks

-   **Cleaning:** Must be washed out with water immediately after use. If concrete hardens inside, it is extremely difficult to remove (requires jackhammering).
-   **Capacity:** Overloading the mixer can damage the motor or bearings and result in poor mixing.
-   **Safety:** Rotating machinery with heavy loads is dangerous; keep hands/tools out of the drum while running.
