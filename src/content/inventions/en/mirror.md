# Brief description

A mirror is a polished surface that reflects light specularly, producing a virtual image of objects in front of it. It is an essential tool for personal care, scientific observation, and signaling.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to provide a visual reflection of objects and light:

- **Personal:** Grooming, dressing, and self-inspection.
- **Optics:** Used in reflecting telescopes, periscopes, microscopes, and lasers to redirect light.
- **Signaling:** Heliographs use mirrors to send messages via reflected sunlight over long distances.
- **Energy:** Concentrating solar power using parabolic mirrors to generate heat or electricity.
- **Decoration:** Increasing the sense of space and improving interior lighting.
- **Scale:** Domestic (personal mirrors), Industrial (telescopes, solar plants).

## Operating principle

It relies on the physical phenomenon of **specular reflection**:

- **Reflection:** When light hits a smooth surface, it bounces off at the same angle it arrived (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).
- **Coherence:** Unlike a rough surface that scatters light (diffuse reflection), an extremely smooth surface preserves the parallel nature of light rays, forming a clear image.
- **Virtual Image:** The brain perceives the reflected rays as if they were coming from a point behind the mirror, creating a "virtual" version of the object.

## How to create it

- **Polished Metal (Basic):** Take a flat plate of bronze, silver, or copper. Use progressively finer abrasives (sand, silt, then fine cloth) to polish the surface until it becomes highly reflective.
- **Silvered Glass (Advanced):**
  1.  **Preparation:** Thoroughly clean a flat sheet of **[glass](/en/materials/glass)**.
  2.  **Sensitization:** Apply a tin chloride solution to help the metal stick to the glass.
  3.  **Silvering:** Pour a mixture of silver nitrate and a reducing agent (like glucose) over the glass. The silver precipitates out of the solution and bonds to the glass surface.
  4.  **Protection:** Once dry, paint the back of the silver layer with a dark, opaque paint to prevent oxidation and scratches.
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate (polished metal) to Advanced (chemical silvering).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Metal:** Silver, tin, or aluminum for the reflective layer.
  - **Substrate:** Flat **[glass](/en/materials/glass)** for modern mirrors or a solid metal plate for ancient ones.
  - **Chemicals:** Silver nitrate, ammonia, and glucose (for the chemical silvering process).
- **Tools:** Polishing cloths, fine abrasives, level surface for pouring chemicals.
- **Possible Substitutes:** Still water in a dark container, polished **[obsidian](/en/materials/obsidian)**, or highly polished stainless steel.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ancient Mirrors:** Made of solid polished bronze or obsidian. They required constant maintenance as they tarnished quickly.
- **Mercury-Tin Mirrors:** (16th-19th century) A tin foil was coated with mercury to create an amalgam on glass. Very clear but highly toxic to make.
- **Silvered Mirrors:** Modern standard using chemical precipitation of silver. See **[Silver Mirror](/en/inventions/silver-mirror)** for the detailed chemical process. More reflective and durable.
- **Aluminized Mirrors:** Uses vacuum deposition of aluminum. Common in telescopes and industrial applications due to high durability and cost-effectiveness.

## Limits and risks

- **Oxidation:** The reflective metal layer (especially silver) can tarnish if exposed to air or moisture, causing dark spots.
- **Fragility:** Glass-based mirrors are highly susceptible to impact and thermal shock.
- **Toxicity:** Antique mirror-making processes involving mercury pose severe health risks (mercury poisoning).
- **Surface Quality:** Any imperfection or scratch on the surface will distort the reflected image.
