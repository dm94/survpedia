# Brief description

A mirror is a polished surface that reflects light specularly, producing a virtual image of objects in front of it.

## Use / Function

- **Personal:** Grooming and dressing.
- **Optics:** Reflecting telescopes, periscopes, lasers.
- **Signaling:** Heliographs (sunlight signals).
- **Decoration:** Increasing the sense of space and lighting.

## Operating principle

It relies on **reflection**. An extremely smooth surface causes photons to bounce off at the same angle of incidence, preserving the coherence of the image.

## How to create it

- **Polished Metal:** Polish a metal plate (bronze, silver, copper) until reflective (ancient method).
- **Silvered Glass:** Apply a thin layer of reflective metal (tin-mercury formerly, silver or aluminum today) onto one side of a glass sheet. The glass protects the metal from oxidation and provides a perfectly smooth surface.
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate (polished metal) to Advanced (silvered glass).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Metal (silver, tin, aluminum) or flat glass and silvering chemicals.
- **Tools:** Polishing cloths, fine abrasives.
- **Substitutes:** Still water in a dark container, polished obsidian.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bronze Mirror:** Common in antiquity, tarnishes and requires constant repolishing.
- **Mercury Glass Mirror:** Venetian, very clear but toxic to manufacture.
- **Silver Mirror:** Modern, high reflectivity, and durable.
- **Parabolic Mirror:** Curved to concentrate light (solar energy) or for telescopes.

## Limits and risks

- **Oxidation:** Metal mirrors tarnish over time.
- **Fragility:** Glass mirrors break (bad luck superstition).
- **Toxicity:** Antique mirrors used mercury, which is highly toxic.
