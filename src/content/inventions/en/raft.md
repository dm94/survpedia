A raft is a flat structure for support or transportation over water. It is the most basic boat design, characterized by the absence of a hull.

## Construction

1. **Material Gathering**: Logs, reeds, or planks are gathered.
2. **Alignment**: The materials are placed side-by-side to form a flat platform.
3. **Lashing**: The components are tied together using ropes, vines, or leather thongs.
4. **Stabilization**: Cross-beams may be added to increase the structural integrity of the raft.

## History

Rafts have been used for thousands of years. They were likely the first form of water transport used by humans to cross rivers and lakes, and even to migrate across oceans in some cases, such as the settlement of Polynesia.
