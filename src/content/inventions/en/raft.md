A raft is a flat structure for support or transportation over water. It is the most basic boat design, characterized by the absence of a hull.

## Construction

1. **Material Gathering**: Logs, reeds, or planks are gathered.
2. **Alignment**: The materials are placed side-by-side to form a flat platform.
3. **Lashing**: The components are tied together using ropes, vines, or leather thongs.
4. **Stabilization**: Cross-beams may be added to increase the structural integrity of the raft.
