# Brief description

A raft is a flat structure for support or transportation over water. It is the simplest form of watercraft, characterized by the absence of a hull. Instead, it relies on the buoyancy of its materials to stay afloat.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** Moving loads or people across water bodies.
- **River Crossing:** Simple way to cross rivers where bridges or deep-water vessels are unavailable.
- **Emergency survival:** Quickly constructed floating platform.

## Operating principle

**Buoyancy:** A raft stays afloat because it is made of materials less dense than water (like wood or air-filled bladders), or because it displaces enough water to support its weight. Unlike a boat, it does not have a hollow hull to displace water; the entire structure provides buoyancy.

## How to create it

1. **Material Gathering:** Collect buoyant materials like dry logs, bamboo, or bundles of reeds.
2. **Alignment:** Lay the primary logs side-by-side to the desired width.
3. **Lashing:** Use strong rope, vines, or leather thongs to tie the logs together. Typically, cross-beams are placed perpendicular to the main logs and lashed at every intersection for stability.
4. **Decking (Optional):** Add a second layer of lighter branches or planks on top to keep passengers and cargo drier.

## Materials needed

- **Buoyant body:** Dry logs (pine, balsa), bamboo, or reed bundles.
- **Lashing:** Rope (plant-fibers), vines, or leather strips.
- **Tools:** Axe or knife for cutting and notching.

## Variants and improvements

- **Log Raft:** Most basic, very durable but heavy and slow.
- **Bamboo Raft:** Lightweight and flexible, common in many tropical regions.
- **Inflatable Raft:** Modern version using air-filled chambers for extreme buoyancy and portability.

## Limits and risks

- **Maneuverability:** Very difficult to steer or propel against currents or wind.
- **Structural Integrity:** Lashing can loosen or break over time, causing the raft to disassemble.
- **Exposure:** Provides little protection from water or weather; passengers often get wet.
