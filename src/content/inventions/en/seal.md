# Brief description

A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or another medium, typically to authenticate a document or to secure a container. It acts as a signature, guaranteeing the identity of the sender and the integrity of the message or goods.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is security and identity:

- **Authentication:** Proving that a document or order truly comes from the claimed authority (King, Merchant, Official).
- **Tamper-Evidence:** Sealing a letter or jar so that it cannot be opened without breaking the seal.
- **Ownership:** Marking goods (like pottery or livestock) to indicate property.
- **Bureaucracy:** Validating legal acts and contracts.

## Operating principle

The principle is the **Mechanical Reproduction of a Unique Pattern**.
1. **Matrix (The Seal):** A hard material (stone, metal) is carved with a unique design (negative image).
2. **Impression:** The matrix is pressed into a soft material (wet clay, hot wax) or inked and pressed onto paper.
3. **Result:** A positive image is left behind, which is difficult to replicate without the original matrix.

## How to create it

- **Step 1: Material Selection:** Choose a hard, durable material like stone (steatite, hematite), bone, or metal.
- **Step 2: Carving:** Use fine abrasive tools (obsidian flakes, copper drills with sand) to carve a design in reverse (mirror image).
- **Step 3: Design:** Include unique symbols, names, or intricate patterns to make forgery difficult.
- **Step 4: Handle:** Shape the seal for gripping (stamp seal) or for rolling (cylinder seal) or wearing (ring).

## Materials needed

- **Matrix Material:**
  - **Stone:** Semi-precious stones were common for durability and difficulty to carve.
  - **Metal:** Gold, silver, or bronze for durability and status.
  - **Bone/Ivory/Wood:** Cheaper alternatives.
- **Impression Material:**
  - **Clay:** For sealing tablet envelopes or jar stoppers.
  - **Beeswax:** Mixed with resin (sealing wax) for parchment or paper.
  - **Lead:** For papal bulls or heavy official seals (bullae).

## Variants and improvements

- **Cylinder Seals:** Used in Mesopotamia; rolled over clay to create a continuous strip of images.
- **Stamp Seals:** Pressed flat; common in Egypt and Indus Valley.
- **Signet Rings:** A seal worn on the finger for convenience and security.
- **Asian Chops/Hanko:** Inked stamps used in East Asia instead of relief impressions.
- **Embossing:** Creating raised relief on paper without ink.

## Limits and risks

- **Theft:** If a seal is stolen, the thief can impersonate the owner perfectly.
- **Forgery:** Skilled craftsmen can create replicas, though intricate details make this harder.
- **Wear:** Soft stone seals can wear down over time, losing clarity.
- **Fragility of Impression:** Wax or clay seals can break, destroying the proof of authenticity.
