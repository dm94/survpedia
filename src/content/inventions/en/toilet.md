# Brief description

A sanitation fixture used for the disposal of human excrement and urine. Modern flush toilets use water to move waste through a drainpipe to a sewer system or septic tank, maintaining hygiene and preventing odors.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Safe and hygienic disposal of human waste.
- **Secondary uses**: Disposal of liquid waste.
- **Scale**: Domestic to public/institutional.

## Operating principle

The core principle is the **siphon** (S-trap or P-trap):

1.  **Water Seal**: The bowl always holds a small amount of water in a U-shaped bend. This water acts as a seal, preventing sewer gases (methane, hydrogen sulfide) from entering the room.
2.  **Flushing**: When the flush mechanism is triggered, a large volume of water from the **cistern** (tank) is released rapidly into the bowl.
3.  **Siphon Action**: The rapid influx of water fills the siphon tube, creating a vacuum effect that pulls the waste and water out of the bowl and into the drainpipe.
4.  **Refill**: After the flush, the tank refills via a **float valve**, and a small tube refills the bowl to restore the water seal.

## How to create it

### 1. The Bowl (Ceramic)

- Must be smooth and non-porous to be easy to clean and prevent bacterial growth. **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics)** (glazed porcelain) are ideal.
- Needs an integrated S-trap or P-trap channel at the bottom.

### 2. The Cistern (Tank)

- A container positioned above the bowl (gravity fed).
- **Inlet Valve**: Controlled by a float. When water level drops, it opens to refill; when full, it closes.
- **Flush Valve**: A flapper or siphon mechanism that releases water into the bowl when the handle is pressed.

### 3. Connections

- **Water Supply**: Connects to the main **[Water Supply](/en/inventions/water-supply)** line.
- **Drainage**: Connects to the **[Sewage System](/en/inventions/sewage-system)** or **[Septic Tank](/en/inventions/septic-tank)**.
- **Vent**: The drain pipe must be vented to the roof to allow air in, preventing the siphon from sucking the trap dry.

## Materials needed

- **Bowl/Tank**: **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics)** (Vitreous China) for durability and hygiene. Could be **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** or **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)** (stainless steel) in institutional/prison settings.
- **Mechanism**: **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** or **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)** for valves and levers.
- **Seal**: Wax ring (to seal the toilet to the floor flange) and rubber gaskets.
- **Seat**: **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Squat Toilet**: Common in Asia/Middle East. No seat, flush is often manual (bucket). Healthier posture.
- **Composting Toilet**: Does not use water. Uses sawdust/peat moss to decompose waste aerobically. Good for off-grid.
- **Low-flow / Dual-flush**: Uses less water (e.g., 3L for liquid, 6L for solid) to conserve resources.
- **Vacuum Toilet**: Uses air suction (planes, trains) to minimize water usage.

## Limits and risks

- **Clogging**: Too much paper or foreign objects can block the siphon.
- **Leakage**: A leaking flapper valve wastes huge amounts of water silently.
- **Seal Failure**: If the wax ring fails, sewer gas and water can leak into the floor.
- **Water Dependence**: Requires a reliable **[Water Supply](/en/inventions/water-supply)**. Without water, it cannot function properly and becomes a health hazard.
