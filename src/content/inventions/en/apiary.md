# Brief description

An apiary is a managed site where multiple bee hives are placed, protected, and maintained for efficient **[Beekeeping](/en/knowledge/beekeeping)**.

## Use / Function

- **Hive organization**: Keeps colonies in a single, manageable area.
- **Protection**: Reduces wind, moisture, and predator exposure with barriers and spacing.
- **Workflow**: Allows inspection, harvest, and feeding with minimal disruption.
- **Scale**: From a few backyard hives to village-level production.

## Operating principle

- **Site selection**: Sun, dry ground, and clear flight paths improve colony health.
- **Spacing**: Separation limits drifting, disease spread, and robbing.
- **Access control**: Clear paths and stable stands prevent tipping.
- **Resource proximity**: Nearby **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and forage reduce stress.

## How to create it

1. **Choose the site**: Pick a sunny, well-drained area with windbreaks and clean **[Water](/en/materials/water)** nearby.
2. **Lay out rows**: Mark hive positions with clear approach paths and enough spacing for work.
3. **Build stands**: Use level **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frames or **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** pads to keep hives off damp ground.
4. **Add barriers**: Install fences or screens woven from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** to guide bee flight upward.
5. **Protect and label**: Seal joints with **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** and mark hives for tracking.
6. **Operate**: Use **[Controlled Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** smoke sparingly and **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for harvests.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Layout and stands are low tech; stable multi-hive management requires routine skill.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for stands and hive supports, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or compacted earth for stable pads, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for screens.
- **Tools**: Cutting tools, mallet, measuring cord, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for honey handling.
- **Possible substitutes**: Packed earth berms, clay pads, or woven brush for windbreaks.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fence apiary**: Enclosed yard to deter livestock and theft.
- **Migratory apiary**: Portable stands for seasonal bloom.
- **Terraced apiary**: Stepped layout on slopes for drainage and access.
- **Shade structures**: Light roofing in hot climates to reduce heat stress.

## Limits and risks

- **Disease spread**: Too many hives in tight space accelerate pests.
- **Robbing pressure**: High density increases inter-colony theft.
- **Overheating**: Poor ventilation and no shade can weaken colonies.
- **Access hazards**: Unstable stands and clutter increase stings and spills.
