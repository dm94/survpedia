# Brief description

A small fastener, typically a flat disk, that secures two pieces of fabric together by sliding through a loop or a buttonhole.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Fastening clothing (shirts, coats, pants).
- **Secondary uses**: Decoration/Ornamentation.

## Operating Principle

Mechanical interference. The button is larger than the hole it passes through. Once turned sideways to pass through the slit (buttonhole), it returns to a flat position and cannot be pulled back through easily.

## How to create it

1.  **Shape**: Cut a disk from bone, wood, or shell.
2.  **Drill**: Drill 2 or 4 holes in the center for the thread.
3.  **Polish**: Smooth the edges to prevent cutting the fabric or thread.

## Materials needed

- **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**: Durable and easy to carve.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: Common but can rot if not treated.
- **[Shell](/en/materials/pearl)**: Mother of pearl, very durable and beautiful.
- **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)**: Bronze, brass, etc.

## Variants and improvements

- **Shank Button**: Has a loop on the back instead of holes through the center.
- **Toggle**: A bar shape instead of a disk, passed through a loop.

## Limits and risks

- **Loss**: Threads can wear out, causing the button to fall off.
- **Breaking**: Brittle materials (shell, some bone) can crack under pressure.
