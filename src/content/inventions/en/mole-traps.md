# Brief description

Mole traps are mechanical devices placed in active tunnels to capture or kill moles, reducing damage to crops, roots, and irrigation lines.

## Use / Function

- **Pest control:** Stops tunneling that undermines soil and roots.
- **Crop protection:** Prevents seedling loss and root pruning.
- **Infrastructure protection:** Reduces damage to paths, irrigation, and embankments.
- **Scale:** Farm, garden, and homestead.

## Operating principle

The trap is set inside a tunnel and triggered by the animal’s movement or pressure against a trigger plate or wire. Stored energy (spring force, bent wire, or a weighted deadfall) releases quickly, closing a loop or jaws across the tunnel.

## How to create it

1. **Locate an active tunnel:** Press the surface to find fresh runs and reopen a small section.
2. **Choose a mechanism:** A wire noose, scissor-style jaws, or a deadfall block.
3. **Prepare a guide:** Use **[Wire](/en/inventions/wire)** or wooden guides so the trigger sits centered in the tunnel.
4. **Set the trigger:** Light, balanced trigger that fires with slight pressure.
5. **Stabilize:** Pack soil around the trap to prevent wobble and block light.
6. **Check regularly:** Reset or remove when triggered.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frame or stakes, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** for the spring or jaws.
- **Tools:** Shovel, knife, hammer, pliers.
- **Substitutes:** **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** for noose traps, a **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** weight for deadfall.

## Variants and improvements

- **Scissor trap:** Strong spring jaws for quick kill.
- **Noose trap:** Simple loop that tightens around the animal.
- **Deadfall trap:** Weighted stone or log triggered by a peg.
- **Tunnel box:** A covered box trap that blocks light and keeps pets away.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Can harm pets or beneficial wildlife if placed poorly.
- **Safety:** Spring traps can injure hands during setting.
- **Soil conditions:** Loose or wet soil can misalign the trigger.
- **Ethics and legality:** Local rules may restrict lethal traps.
