# Brief description

A tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. One of the earliest tools used by humanity, evolving from stone flakes to refined steel blades.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Cutting, slicing, and piercing materials.
- **Secondary uses**: Food preparation, self-defense, carving wood.
- **Scale**: Manual, individual use.

## Operating principle

The knife operates on the principle of the wedge (an inclined plane).
- **Concentrated Force**: The force applied to the handle is concentrated on the extremely small surface area of the edge, creating immense pressure that separates material fibers.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Blade**: Forge a piece of steel into a flat shape, then grind one edge to a bevel.
2.  **Heat Treatment**: Harden the blade (heat and quench) and temper it (reheat slightly) to balance hardness and toughness.
3.  **Handle**: Attach scales (wood/bone) to the tang using pins or wrap with leather/cord.
4.  **Sharpening**: Hone the edge on a whetstone.

### Technical level
- **Basic to Advanced**: Simple knives can be ground from scrap metal; high-quality knives require precise heat treatment and forging skills.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Steel**: High-carbon steel is preferred for edge retention (hardness) but stainless steel resists rust.
    - **Handle Material**: Wood, bone, antler, or leather for grip.
- **Tools**:
    - **Forge/Torch**: For heat treatment.
    - **Grinder/Files**: For shaping the bevels.
    - **Whetstone**: For sharpening.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fixed Blade**: Stronger, no moving parts (e.g., survival knife, kitchen knife).
- **Folding Knife**: Safer for carry, blade folds into handle (e.g., pocket knife).
- **Serrated Edge**: Better for sawing through fibrous materials like rope or bread.
- **Full Tang**: The metal of the blade extends through the full length of the handle for maximum strength.

## Limits and risks

- **Brittleness**: If too hard, the blade may chip or snap under impact or prying.
- **Dullness**: Requires regular maintenance (sharpening) to remain effective; a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because it requires more force to cut, increasing slip risk.
- **Corrosion**: Carbon steel will rust if not kept dry and oiled.
