# Brief description

A yoke is a wooden beam, normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load when working in pairs, as in a [cart](/en/inventions/cart), [wagon](/en/inventions/wagon), or plow.

## Use / Function

- **Drafting:** Connecting draft animals (oxen, horses, buffalo) to a vehicle or implement.
- **Plowing:** Essential for agricultural tillage.
- **Transport:** Enabling heavy hauling.

## Operating principle

The yoke harnesses the power of the animal by distributing the load across a strong part of their anatomy (neck/shoulders).

- **Load Distribution:** By resting on the shoulders (withers) or neck, the animal can push against the load with its powerful leg muscles.
- **Coordination:** A double yoke forces two animals to move in unison, combining their strength.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection:** Choose a strong, seasoned log of hardwood (elm, ash, hickory) that is slightly curved or can be shaped.
2.  **Shaping:** Carve the log to fit comfortably over the necks of the animals. The contact points must be smooth and rounded to prevent chafing.
3.  **Boring:** Drill holes for the bow pins or straps that will hold the yoke in place.
4.  **Bows:** Create U-shaped bows (from bent wood or iron) that go under the animal's neck and up through the yoke beam.
5.  **Hitching:** Attach a central ring or loop (staple) to the middle of the yoke to connect the draft pole of the vehicle.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Tough, non-splintering hardwood.
- **Iron:** For the central ring and reinforcement.
- **Leather:** For padding or straps.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bow Yoke:** Used for oxen, resting on the neck.
- **Head Yoke:** Strapped to the horns of oxen (common in Spain/Latin America).
- **Withers Yoke:** Used for horses/donkeys (though a collar is better for horses as a yoke can choke them).
- **Single Yoke:** For one animal.

## Limits and risks

- **Choking:** A simple neck yoke is poor for horses because it presses on their windpipe when pulling hard. Horses need a collar harness.
- **Chafing:** Poorly fitted yokes can cause sores and infection, rendering the animal useless.
- ** breakage:** If the beam breaks under load, the animals can be injured or the load lost.
