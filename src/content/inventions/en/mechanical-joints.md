# Brief description

Nails and mechanical joints are methods for fastening two or more objects together. They range from simple friction-based pegs to complex interlocking woodworking joints and forged metal fasteners.

## Use / Function

- **Construction:** Building shelters, houses, and large structures.
- **Shipbuilding:** Joining planks and frames to create watertight hulls.
- **Furniture:** Creating stable tables, chairs, and chests.
- **Machinery:** Assembling wooden or metal gears and frames.

## Operating principle

Mechanical joints work by using physical interference and friction. A nail or peg creates a high-pressure contact point that resists being pulled out. Interlocking joints (like dovetails) use the geometry of the materials to prevent separation in specific directions.

## How to create it

1.  **Preparation:** Cut the materials to be joined to their required sizes.
2.  **Fastener Creation:** For nails, forge or carve a pointed pin with a head. For joints, carve matching shapes (male and female) in the materials.
3.  **Assembly:** Drive the nail through the pieces or fit the joint together.
4.  **Securing:** Clinch the end of the nail or use a wedge/peg to lock a joint in place.

## Materials needed

- **Fasteners:** Wood (pegs), Copper, Bronze, or Iron (nails).
- **Substrate:** Wood or stone to be joined.
- **Tools:** Hammer, chisel, saw, drill (auger), or forge.

## Variants and improvements

- **Tree-nails (Treenails):** Wooden pegs that swell when wet, perfect for ships.
- **Mortise and Tenon:** A classic hole-and-tongue joint for extreme stability.
- **Dovetail Joint:** Interlocking "fingers" that resist being pulled apart.
- **Screws and Bolts:** Modern improvements that use threading for even greater holding power.

## Limits and risks

- **Corrosion:** Metal nails can rust or corrode, weakening the structure.
- **Wood Splitting:** Driving a nail too close to the edge can split the wood.
- **Loosening:** Vibrations or changes in humidity (causing wood to shrink/swell) can loosen joints over time.
- **Stress Concentration:** High stress at the fastener point can cause the material around it to fail.
