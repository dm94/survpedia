# Brief description

A hand drill is a manually operated tool used for boring holes in various materials. It applies torque and axial force to a [Drill Bit](drill-bit) to cut into wood, metal, plastic, or stone.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is to drill holes without the need for electricity.

- **Primary use**: Drilling holes for joinery (dowels, screws) or assembly.
- **Secondary uses**: Driving screws (if equipped with a screwdriver bit), mixing paint (with appropriate attachment).
- **Scale**: Individual/Workshop.

## Operating principle

The hand drill converts manual linear or rotational motion into high-speed rotation of the chuck holding the bit.

- **Brace (Berbiquí)**: Uses a crank handle. The user sweeps their arm in a circle. High torque, low speed. Good for large auger bits in wood.
- **Geared Hand Drill (Eggbeater)**: Uses a hand crank connected to a large gear, which drives a smaller pinion gear attached to the chuck. This gears up the speed (e.g., 1 turn of the handle = 4 turns of the bit). High speed, lower torque. Good for small holes.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Bow Drill)

A wooden spindle, a hearth board, a bearing block (wood/stone), and a bow with a string. Moving the bow back and forth rotates the spindle.

### Intermediate version (Pump Drill)

A spindle with a flywheel (weight) and a crossbar with cords winding around the spindle. Pushing the crossbar down unwinds the cords, spinning the drill; the flywheel momentum rewinds the cords for the next stroke.

### Advanced version (Bit Brace / Geared Drill)

Requires metalworking.

1.  **Frame**: Forged iron or steel rod bent into a crank shape (for a brace) or a cast frame (for geared drill).
2.  **Gears**: (For geared drill) Cut teeth into metal disks to create a gear train.
3.  **Chuck**: A mechanism (usually with 2 or 3 jaws) to securely hold the drill bit.
4.  **Handles**: Wood handles for the crank and the main grip, allowing free rotation.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **Wood**: For handles, knobs, and primitive drill bodies.
  - **Metal (Iron/Steel)**: For the shaft, gears, chuck, and the bit itself.
- **Tools**: Forge, files, lathe (for precise gears/shafts), woodworking tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bow Drill**: Primitive, slow, requires two hands (or one hand and mouth/chest).
- **Brace**: High torque, great for carpentry.
- **Push Drill (Archimedes Screw)**: Pushing a handle down a spiraled shaft causes rotation. Very fast for small holes.
- **Breast Drill**: A larger geared drill with a plate to lean against with the chest, allowing more pressure.

## Limits and risks

- **Speed limit**: Manually limited. Hard to drill large holes in hard metals (like thick steel) without fatigue.
- **Stability**: It can be difficult to keep the drill perfectly straight by hand.
- **Bit breakage**: Uneven pressure or wobbling can snap fine drill bits.
