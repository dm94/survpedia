# Brief description

An awl is a simple tool consisting of a slender, tapering metal or bone spike with a sharp point, usually fixed in a handle. It is used for piercing small holes in **[leather](/en/materials/leather)**, wood, or other materials, often as a preliminary step for sewing or inserting fasteners.

## Use / Function

- **Piercing:** Making holes in tough materials (**[leather](/en/materials/leather)**, thick canvas) that a needle cannot penetrate on its own.
- **Scribing:** Marking lines on wood or metal (scratch awl).
- **Basketry:** Manipulating strands in weaving.
- **Sewing:** Assisting in stitching heavy materials (cobbling, saddlery).

## Operating principle

The awl works by **displacement** and **wedging**. The sharp point concentrates force to separate fibers or grains of the material. As the tool is pushed deeper, the widening shaft expands the hole to the desired size without removing material (unlike a drill).

## How to create it

### Primitive Awl

1.  **Material:** Select a strong bone splinter (antler or leg bone) or a hard thorn.
2.  **Shaping:** Grind it against sandstone to form a sturdy, sharp point.
3.  **Handling:** Wrap one end in leather or fit it into a wooden handle for better grip.

### Metal Awl

1.  **Forging:** Hammer a metal rod to a point at one end and a tang (tapered tail) at the other.
2.  **Hardening:** If using steel, heat and quench the point to harden it.
3.  **Hafting:** Drill a hole in a wooden handle. Insert the tang of the metal spike. Friction or glue (resin) holds it in place.
4.  **Sharpening:** Sharpen the point on a whetstone.

## Materials needed

- **Spike:** Bone, Copper, Bronze, Iron, Steel.
- **Handle:** Wood, Antler, Bone.
- **Binding:** Resin, Leather strips (optional).

## Variants and improvements

- **Stitching Awl:** Has a hole near the point (like a needle) to carry thread through the hole as it pierces (for lockstitching).
- **Scratch Awl:** Hardened point for marking wood/metal.
- **Bradawl:** Chisel-shaped point for making holes in wood for screws/nails without splitting the grain.

## Limits and risks

- **Bending:** If the point is too thin or soft, it will bend under pressure.
- **Injury:** Slipping while pushing hard can cause serious puncture wounds to the hand holding the work.
