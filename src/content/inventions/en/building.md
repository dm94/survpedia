# Brief description

A **Building** is a permanent structure with a roof and walls, standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. It provides shelter for human activity.

## Use / Function

- **Shelter:** Protects people and property from weather (rain, wind, sun, cold).
- **Security:** Provides safety from intruders and animals.
- **Activity Space:** Creates a controlled environment for living, working, storage, or assembly.
- **Symbolism:** Represents culture, status, or religious significance.

## Operating principle

A building works as a **system of systems**:

1.  **Structure:** The skeleton (**[Frame](/en/inventions/frame)**, **[Wall](/en/inventions/wall)**, **[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation)**) resists gravity and lateral forces.
2.  **Enclosure:** The skin (**[Roofing](/en/inventions/roofing)**, siding, **[Window](/en/inventions/window)**, **[Door](/en/inventions/door)**) separates indoor from outdoor environments.
3.  **Services:** Systems for comfort and utility (**[Heating](/en/inventions/heating)**, **[Plumbing](/en/inventions/plumbing)**, **[Lighting](/en/inventions/lighting)**).

## How to create it

1.  **Planning:** Determine the function, site, and budget. Design the layout.
2.  **Site Preparation:** Clear the land and excavate for the **[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation)**.
3.  **Structure:** Build the **[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation)**, then the **[Wall](/en/inventions/wall)**s or **[Frame](/en/inventions/frame)**.
4.  **Roofing:** Install the roof structure and covering (**[Roofing](/en/inventions/roofing)**) to make it watertight.
5.  **Enclosure:** Install windows and doors. Apply exterior cladding.
6.  **Finishing:** Install interior walls, floors, and services.

## Materials needed

- **Structural:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**.
- **Enclosure:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**, siding, **[Tile](/en/materials/tile)**.
- **Finishing:** Plaster, paint, flooring.

## Variants and improvements

- **Residential:** Houses, apartments (focus on comfort).
- **Commercial:** Offices, shops (focus on utility and access).
- **Industrial:** Factories, warehouses (focus on large spans and durability).
- **Institutional:** Schools, hospitals (focus on safety and sanitation).
- **High-rise:** Skyscrapers using steel frames and elevators.

## Limits and risks

- **Collapse:** Structural failure due to poor design, earthquakes, or overloading.
- **Fire:** Buildings trap heat and smoke; fire safety is critical.
- **Maintenance:** All buildings degrade over time (rot, rust, weathering) and require upkeep.
- **Environment:** Buildings consume vast amounts of energy and materials.
