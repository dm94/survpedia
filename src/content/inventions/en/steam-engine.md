# Brief description

A heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This reciprocating motion is typically converted into rotational motion for work.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** To power machinery (pumps, mills, factories) and transportation (trains, ships).
- **Secondary Uses:** Generating electricity (steam turbines are modern descendants).
- **Scale:** From small models to massive stationary engines and locomotives.

## Operating principle

1.  **Boiling:** Water is heated in a **[Boiler](/en/inventions/boiler)** to create high-pressure steam.
2.  **Expansion:** The steam enters a cylinder through a valve and expands, pushing a piston.
3.  **Work:** The moving piston pushes a connecting rod, which turns a crankshaft (converting linear to rotary motion).
4.  **Exhaust:** The spent steam is exhausted (vented to the atmosphere or condensed).
5.  **Cycle:** The process repeats. A **[Flywheel](/en/inventions/flywheel)** carries the momentum through the "dead spots" of the cycle.

## How to create it

### Basic Double-Acting Engine

1.  **Cylinder:** A smooth, bored tube of **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)**.
2.  **Piston:** A disk that fits tightly inside the cylinder, often with rings to seal the steam.
3.  **Valves:** A mechanism (slide valve or piston valve) to admit steam to one side of the piston while exhausting it from the other, then switching at the end of the stroke.
4.  **Crankshaft & Flywheel:** Converts the back-and-forth motion to rotation. The heavy **[Flywheel](/en/inventions/flywheel)** is crucial for smooth operation.
5.  **Governor:** A device (often a centrifugal governor) to regulate the speed by controlling the steam flow.

## Materials needed

- **Boiler/Cylinder:** **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** (must withstand high pressure).
- **Piston/Valves:** **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)**, **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, or **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**.
- **Bearings:** **[Slide Bearings](/en/inventions/slide-bearings)** (Bronze/Babbitt).
- **Seals:** **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**, **[Rope](/en/materials/rope)** (packing), or metal rings.
- **Fuel:** **[Coal](/en/materials/coal)**, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, or **[Oil](/en/materials/crude-oil)**.
- **Working Fluid:** **[Water](/en/materials/water)** (clean, soft water to prevent scale).

## Variants and improvements

- **Atmospheric Engine (Newcomen):** Used steam to create a vacuum; atmospheric pressure did the work. Very inefficient.
- **High-Pressure Engine (Watt/Trevithick):** Uses steam pressure above atmospheric. Much smaller and more powerful.
- **Compound Engine:** Steam is used in one cylinder, then exhausted into a larger cylinder to extract more energy.
- **Steam Turbine:** Steam spins blades directly (no piston). Used in power plants today.

## Limits and risks

- **Explosion:** Boiler explosions are catastrophic. Safety valves and regular inspection are mandatory.
- **Efficiency:** Early engines were very inefficient (1-5%). Modern turbines are much better but still limited by thermodynamics.
- **Maintenance:** Requires constant lubrication, cleaning (boiler scale), and seal replacement.
