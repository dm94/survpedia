# Brief description

Clothing and fabrics are body coverings made from animal or vegetable materials to protect the body and maintain temperature.

## Use / Function

- **Thermal protection:** Insulation against cold or excessive heat.
- **Physical protection:** Barrier against abrasions, insects, and solar rays.
- **Transport:** Allows adding pockets or anchor points for tools.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

It traps a layer of air near the skin that acts as a thermal insulator. Fabrics allow for breathability (evaporation of sweat) while blocking direct heat loss through convection.

## How to create it

1. **Obtainment:** **[Tan](/en/knowledge/tanning)** animal skins (**[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**) or collect plant/animal fibers (linen, cotton, wool, silk).
2. **Processing:** Spin the fibers to create long, strong threads.
3. **Joining:** Weave the threads on a loom or sew skin pieces together using bone needles and tendons or threads.
4. **Technical level:** Basic (skins) to Intermediate (fabrics).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Skins, wool, cotton, silk, or bark fibers.
- **Tools:** **[Scrapers](/en/inventions/scraper)** for skins, spindles for spinning, **[needles](/en/inventions/needle)** (bone/wood), simple looms.
- **Substitutes:** Large leaves, beaten bark (tapa).

## Variants and improvements

- **Unsewn skins:** Simple capes.
- **Sewn clothing:** Fitted to the body, more thermally efficient.
- **Loom-woven fabrics:** Lighter, more versatile, and easier to wash.
- **Dyed clothing:** Treated with **[Textile Dye](/en/materials/textile-dye)** for social signaling or camouflage.

## Limits and risks

- **Degradation:** Organic materials rot with moisture if not treated.
- **Parasites:** Clothing can harbor lice or mites if not kept clean.
- **Flammability:** Dry fibers burn easily.
