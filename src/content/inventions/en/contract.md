# Brief description

A contract is a binding agreement between two or more parties that creates legal obligations, while a registry is a centralized record of events, ownership, or transactions. Together, they form the backbone of organized society, enabling trust beyond immediate family ties and allowing for complex economic and social structures.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to formalize relationships and preserve truth:

- **Trade and Commerce:** Ensuring goods are delivered and payments are made (e.g., promissory notes, bills of sale).
- **Property Rights:** Defining who owns land, livestock, or goods (deeds).
- **Governance:** Recording laws, censuses, taxes, and treaties.
- **Social Status:** Recording births, marriages, and deaths.
- **Accountability:** Creating a paper trail that can be audited or disputed.

## Operating principle

The core principle is **Evidence** and **Consensus**.

1. **Agreement/Fact:** Parties agree on terms or a fact occurs.
2. **Record:** The terms or fact are encoded into a durable medium (Written Language).
3. **Authentication:** The record is validated by a trusted mark (Signature, Seal) or witness.
4. **Storage:** The record is kept in a secure place (Registry/Archive) for future reference.

## How to create it

- **Step 1: Negotiation:** Define the terms clearly. Who does what, when, and for how much?
- **Step 2: Drafting:** Write it down using unambiguous language.
- **Step 3: Authentication:** Apply a unique identifier. In early history, this was a cylinder seal rolled on wet clay. Later, signatures and wax seals.
- **Step 4: Duplication:** Often, two copies are made (one for each party), or a third copy for a neutral registry.
- **Step 5: Registration:** Deposit a copy in a central authority (temple, city hall) to make it public knowledge.

## Materials needed

- **Support Medium:**
  - **Clay Tablets:** Durable, fire-resistant, used for permanent records.
  - **Papyrus/Parchment/Paper:** Portable, suitable for everyday contracts.
  - **Stone/Metal:** For eternal laws or treaties.
- **Marking Tool:** Stylus, Pen, Brush, Ink.
- **Authentication:**
  - **Seal:** Stone or metal matrix to impress clay or wax.
  - **Witnesses:** People who verify the transaction.

## Variants and improvements

- **Tally Sticks:** Wood pieces split in half to record debt (impossible to falsify).
- **Clay Envelopes:** A clay tablet enclosed in a clay shell to prevent tampering.
- **Notarization:** A trusted third party validates the contract.
- **Ledgers:** Books recording multiple transactions (Double-entry bookkeeping).
- **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing contracts on a blockchain.

## Limits and risks

- **Enforceability:** A contract is useless without a power (law/community) to enforce it.
- **Fraud/Forgery:** Documents can be altered or faked.
- **Loss:** Fire, flood, or rot can destroy registries (hence the value of clay or stone).
- **Ambiguity:** Poorly worded contracts lead to disputes.
