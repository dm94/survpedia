# Brief description

Fishing line is a thin, strong cord designed to transmit tension between a fisher and a hook or net.

## Use / Function

- **Connection**: Links hook, lure, or net to the hand or rod.
- **Control**: Allows setting depth and retrieving the catch.
- **Flexibility**: Works as hand line, leader, or drop line.

## Operating principle

Multiple fibers twisted and counter-twisted create friction and shared load. A smooth, waxed surface reduces water absorption and abrasion.

## How to create it

1. **Select fibers**: Use long **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
2. **Twist strands**: Spin into thin cords, then ply two or three cords together.
3. **Stretch and smooth**: Tension the line to remove slack and uneven spots.
4. **Seal**: Rub with **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** or resin for water resistance.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Plant fibers or cotton for the line core.
- **Optional**: **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** thongs for leaders or heavy lines.
- **Tools**: Spindle, smooth board, and knife for trimming.

## Variants and improvements

- **Hand line**: Simple coiled line with a single hook.
- **Braided line**: Stronger for the same diameter.
- **Tapered leader**: Thicker near the hand, thinner at the hook.

## Limits and risks

- **Abrasion**: Rubbing on rocks or shells frays the line.
- **Rot**: Natural fibers degrade if stored wet.
- **Knot failure**: Poor knots reduce strength sharply.
