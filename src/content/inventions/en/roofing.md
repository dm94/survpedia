# Brief description

Roofing is the top covering of a building, including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind.

## Use / Function

- **Protection:** Shield the interior from weather elements (rain, snow, wind, sun).
- **Insulation:** Keep the interior warm in winter and cool in summer.
- **Drainage:** Channel water away from the structure to prevent damage.
- **Aesthetics:** Define the visual character of the building.

## Operating principle

Most roofing systems rely on **gravity** and **overlapping layers** to shed water. The roof is built at an angle (pitch) so that water runs off before it can penetrate the materials. The outer layer (tiles, shingles, thatch) overlaps in such a way that water flows from one unit to the next without finding a gap to enter. Flashing is used at joints and intersections to direct water over the surface rather than behind it.

## How to create it

1.  **Structure (**[Frame](/en/inventions/frame)**):** Build a framework of rafters or **[Trusses](/en/inventions/truss)** (usually **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**) to support the roof load.
2.  **Decking (Sheathing):** (Optional) Lay a solid base of boards or plywood over the rafters.
3.  **Underlayment:** Apply a waterproof membrane (felt, tar paper) to protect against wind-driven rain.
4.  **Battens/Lathing:** (For tiles/slates) Fix horizontal strips of wood to the rafters to hook the tiles onto.
5.  **Covering:** Install the roof covering material (**[Tile](/en/materials/tile)**, **[Slate](/en/materials/slate)**, **[Thatching](/en/inventions/thatching)**), starting from the bottom (eaves) and working up to the top (ridge).
6.  **Flashing:** Install metal strips around chimneys, vents, and valleys to seal joints.
7.  **Ridge Cap:** Seal the very top of the roof where the two sides meet.

## Materials needed

- **Structural:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** beams, bamboo, or steel.
- **Covering:**
  - **[Tile](/en/materials/tile):** Clay or concrete.
  - **[Slate](/en/materials/slate):** Natural stone slabs.
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Shingles or shakes.
  - **[Metal](/en/materials/metal):** Sheets of copper, lead, zinc, or steel.
  - **[Straw](/en/materials/straw):** Used in **[Thatching](/en/inventions/thatching)**.
- **Fasteners:** Nails, pegs, or wire.
- **Waterproofing:** Bitumen, tar, or plant resins.

## Variants and improvements

- **[Thatching](/en/inventions/thatching):** One of the oldest forms, using dry vegetation. Good insulation but high fire risk.
- **Wood Shingles:** Split logs. Beautiful but requires maintenance and fire treatment.
- **Ceramic Tiles:** Durable, fire-resistant, and heavy. Common in warm climates.
- **[Slate](/en/materials/slate):** Natural stone, extremely durable (100+ years) but very heavy and expensive.
- **Metal Roofing:** Lightweight, durable, and fire-resistant. Can be noisy during rain.
- **Green Roof:** Covered with vegetation. Excellent insulation and manages stormwater, but requires strong structure and waterproofing.

## Limits and risks

- **Leaks:** The most common failure. Even small leaks can cause rot and structural damage over time.
- **Wind Damage:** Strong winds can lift tiles or shingles if not properly fastened.
- **Fire:** Thatch and wood roofs are highly flammable. Sparks from a **[Chimney](/en/inventions/chimney)** can ignite them.
- **Weight:** Heavy materials like **[Tile](/en/materials/tile)** and **[Slate](/en/materials/slate)** require a very strong supporting structure.
- **Condensation:** Warm moist air from inside can condense on the cold underside of the roof, causing rot. Ventilation is essential.
