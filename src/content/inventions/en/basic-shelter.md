# Brief description

A basic shelter is a structure designed to protect humans from inclement weather, predators, and external threats. It combines a support structure with layers of insulation.

## Use / Function

- **Thermal protection:** Maintain body heat and protect against wind, rain, or sun.
- **Security:** Delimited space against animals or intruders.
- **Storage:** Dry place to store food and tools.
- **Scale:** Domestic (individual or family).

## Operating principle

It uses materials with low thermal conductivity for insulation and rigid materials for structural integrity. The design usually includes a slope for water drainage and an enclosed space to trap static air (which acts as an insulator).

## How to create it

1. **Structure:** Drive wooden posts into the ground or lean them against each other (teepee or lean-to shape).
2. **Cover:** Interweave branches, place skins, or apply layers of straw/leaves over the structure.
3. **Insulation/Sealing:** Apply mud (clay) in the cracks to prevent drafts or add thick layers of plant material.
4. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Logs or thick branches for the structure, foliage, skins, or bark for the cover.
- **Tools:** Stones for striking, ropes (plant-fibers) for tying.
- **Substitutes:** Natural caves, snow (igloo), stacked stones.

## Variants and improvements

- **Brush shelter:** Very fast to build, minimal protection.
- **Skin tent:** Portable and excellent insulation.
- **Log/Mud cabin:** Permanent, very resistant and thermally efficient.

## Limits and risks

- **Fire:** Materials are usually highly flammable.
- **Collapse:** A poor structure can fall under the weight of snow or strong wind.
- **Moisture:** Without good ventilation, mold or condensation can accumulate.
