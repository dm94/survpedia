# Brief description

A road made by placing sand-covered logs perpendicular to the direction of the road over a low or swampy area.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Allowing passage over swamps, marshes, or mud.
- **Secondary uses:** Temporary military roads or logging roads.

## Operating principle

- **Floating Foundation:** The logs distribute the weight over a large area of soft ground, preventing sinking (similar to a raft).
- **Traction:** The ribbed surface provides grip, though it is bumpy.

## How to create it

1.  **Clear Path:** Remove brush and obstacles.
2.  **Stringers (Optional):** Lay two parallel logs along the edges of the path to act as rails/borders.
3.  **Decking:** Lay logs side-by-side perpendicular to the path. Use logs of uniform diameter if possible.
4.  **Covering:** Fill gaps with [sand](/en/materials/sand) or earth to smooth the ride.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** [Wood](/en/materials/wood) (logs), [Sand](/en/materials/sand) or dirt.
- **Tools:** [Axes](/en/inventions/hand-axe), [Saws](/en/inventions/saw).

## Variants and improvements

- **Plank Road:** Using sawn [planks](/en/materials/wood) instead of round logs (smoother).
- **Puncheon Road:** Using split logs with the flat side up.

## Limits and risks

- **Bumpy Ride:** Very uncomfortable for wagons ("corduroy" refers to the ribbed fabric).
- **Rot:** Wood will eventually rot, especially if not submerged (submerged wood lasts longer).
- **Livestock Hazard:** Horses can break legs in gaps between logs.
