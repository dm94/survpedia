# Brief description

An electric generator is a device that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy, allowing the supply of current for various applications.

## Use / Function

- **Energy:** Electricity supply for lighting.
- **Industry:** Powering electric motors and machinery.
- **Emergency:** Backup systems in case of grid failure.

## Operating principle

It is based on Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. By moving a conductor (copper coil) within a magnetic field (magnets), an electromotive force is induced that generates a flow of electrons or electric current.

## How to create it

1. Build a coil by winding insulated copper wire many times around an axis.
2. Place powerful magnets around the coil.
3. Connect a shaft to a power source (crank, water wheel, turbine) to rotate the coil or the magnets.

## Materials needed

- **Conductor:** Copper wire (essential for its low resistance).
- **Magnetic field:** Permanent magnets or electromagnets (iron core with copper).
- **Structure:** Iron for the core and wood or metal for the frame.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dynamo:** Generates direct current (DC).
- **Alternator:** Generates alternating current (AC), more efficient for transport.
- **Turbines:** Large-scale generators driven by steam, water, or wind.

## Limits and risks

- **Shocks:** Risk of electrocution if there is no insulation.
- **Heat:** The Joule effect generates heat that can melt insulation if overloaded.
- **Dependence:** Requires a constant source of mechanical energy.
