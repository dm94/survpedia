# Brief description

A scarecrow is a field decoy built to discourage birds and small animals from feeding on seeds and crops. It creates a human-like presence and movement that makes fields feel unsafe to approach.

## Use / Function

- **Crop protection:** Reduce bird damage during germination and ripening.
- **Field coverage:** Provide a visible deterrent across open rows.
- **Behavior shaping:** Encourage pests to avoid a specific area over time.
- **Scale:** Single fields to small farms and gardens.

## Operating principle

- **Threat silhouette:** A human-like outline triggers avoidance in many birds.
- **Novelty effect:** Unfamiliar shapes and textures make the area feel unsafe.
- **Motion cues:** Wind-driven movement increases perceived risk.
- **Unpredictability:** Changing position or accessories prevents habituation.

## How to create it

1. **Build the frame:** Lash two straight **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** poles into a cross.
2. **Add padding:** Bundle **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)** or dry grasses to bulk the torso and arms.
3. **Dress it:** Cover with old **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or sacks to form a body.
4. **Shape the head:** Stuff a cloth bag or bundle straw into a round form and tie it on.
5. **Anchor it:** Plant the post firmly and secure with **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or rope so it stays upright in wind.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**, **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**.
- **Tools:** Knife, awl, hammer or stone for driving the post.
- **Possible substitutes:** Reeds for straw, bark or woven mats for fabric, vines for rope.

## Variants and improvements

- **Moving arms:** Add loose joints or weighted sleeves for wind movement.
- **Sound makers:** Hang shells, dry seed pods, or clappers to add noise.
- **Bird-specific layouts:** Use multiple small decoys for flocking birds.
- **Rotation plan:** Move or restyle the scarecrow weekly to stay effective.

## Limits and risks

- **Habituation:** Birds learn when the decoy is static and harmless.
- **Weather damage:** Strong wind and rain can collapse or rot the frame.
- **Coverage limits:** One scarecrow protects only a limited radius.
- **Fire risk:** Dry straw and fabric ignite easily near open flames.
