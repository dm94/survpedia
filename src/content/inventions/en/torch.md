# Brief description

A torch is a portable light source consisting of a stick or rod with one end wrapped in combustible material. It is one of the oldest and most effective forms of mobile lighting before the invention of the electric lamp.

## Use / Function

- **Portable lighting:** Allows seeing in the dark while traveling or exploring.
- **Signaling:** Can be used to send visual signals over a distance.
- **Defense:** Fire can scare away wild animals.
- **Ignition:** Serves to transport fire from one place to another.

## Operating principle

The torch works through the controlled combustion of a fuel (resin, fat, oil) soaking an absorbent material (fabric, vegetable fibers) attached to a holder (wood). The absorbent material acts as a large wick, regulating the flow of fuel to the flame and preventing it from burning too quickly, while the holder allows it to be held without burning the user.

## How to create it

1.  **Holder:** Find a branch of green or hard wood, about 50-70 cm long. Green wood takes longer to burn.
2.  **Head:** Wrap the top end with cloth, old rags, or dry vegetable fibers (like birch bark or rope). Secure it well so it doesn't fall off.
3.  **Fuel:** Generously soak the wrapped head with a flammable but slow-burning material:
    - Pine resin (pitch).
    - Animal fat.
    - Vegetable oil.
    - Natural bitumen.
4.  **Ignition:** Bring the head close to a fire source until it catches.

**Rudimentary version:** A pine branch with high resin content (fatwood) can burn on its own, although it will drip and be consumed faster.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - Wood (for the handle).
  - Fuel (resin, fat, oil).
  - Absorbent material (fabric, fibers).
- **Tools:** Knife (to prepare the wood), initial fire source.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fatwood:** Splinter or branch of resinous wood that burns without the need for an added wick.
- **Rushlight:** Rushes soaked in fat, used for soft domestic lighting.
- **Wax torch:** Rolled fabric dipped in beeswax (cleaner and longer-lasting).

## Limits and risks

- **Fire hazard:** Gives off sparks and drops of burning fuel. Do not use near very dry or flammable materials.
- **Smoke:** Produces smoke that can be suffocating in enclosed spaces or unventilated caves.
- **Limited duration:** A typical torch lasts between 20 and 60 minutes. It is necessary to carry spares or extra fuel.
- **Residue:** Dripping pitch or hot fat can burn the carrier; using a "guard" or protection on the handle is recommended.
