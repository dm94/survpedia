# Brief description

An X-ray tube is a specialized vacuum tube that generates X-rays when high-energy electrons strike a metal target. It is the core source inside any X-ray apparatus.

## Use / Function

- **X-ray generation:** Produces the radiation used for imaging.
- **Control:** Allows a focused beam for medical and industrial radiography.
- **Scalable output:** Works from low-power dental units to high-power industrial systems.

## Operating principle

1. **Thermionic emission:** A tungsten filament heats and emits electrons.
2. **Acceleration:** High voltage drives electrons across a vacuum.
3. **Target impact:** Electrons hit a tungsten target and create X-rays.
4. **Window and filtering:** A thin window releases the beam while filters reduce low-energy dose.

## How to create it

1. **Build the envelope:** Seal a glass bulb with a cathode and tungsten target.
2. **Set electrode spacing:** Align cathode-to-anode distance for stable focus.
3. **Evacuate and seal:** Use a vacuum pump, then seal the tube airtight.
4. **Add high-voltage connections:** Insulate leads and use appropriate feedthroughs.
5. **Mount in shielding:** Place the tube inside a lead-lined housing for safety.

Minimum functional version: sealed tube with tungsten cathode/target, strong vacuum, and basic high-voltage supply. Technical level is advanced due to vacuum work, high voltage, and radiation safety.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** for the envelope, **[Tungsten](/en/materials/tungsten)** for filament/target, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** for conductors.
- **Shielding:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** to block stray radiation.
- **Structure:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for the tube mount and housing.
- **Tools:** Vacuum pump, high-voltage insulation, alignment tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Rotating anode:** Higher power and better heat distribution.
- **Microfocus tube:** Sharper imaging for small parts.
- **Metal-ceramic tube:** More durable and stable in high-power systems.
- **Grid-controlled tube:** Faster pulsing and dose control.
- **Cooling integration:** Paired with an **[X-ray cooling system](/en/inventions/x-ray-cooling-system)** for higher duty cycles.

## Limits and risks

- **Radiation exposure:** Requires strict shielding and controlled operation.
- **High voltage:** Severe electrical hazard during assembly and maintenance.
- **Heat load:** Target damage if cooling is inadequate.
- **Vacuum integrity:** Leaks reduce output and cause failure.
