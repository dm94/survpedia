# Brief description

A hammer is a tool that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. It consists of a weighted "head" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object.

## Use / Function

- **Construction:** Driving nails, fitting parts together (joinery).
- **Forging:** Shaping hot metal on an anvil.
- **Demolition/Breaking:** Breaking stones, concrete, or walls.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

It relies on **amplification of force** and **kinetic energy**.

- The handle acts as a lever to increase the speed of the head.
- The heavy head stores kinetic energy during the swing, which is released almost instantly upon impact, generating a huge force.

## How to create it

1.  **Head Selection:**
    - **Stone:** Find a hard, dense stone (granite, basalt) that fits in the hand but has weight.
    - **Metal:** Cast or forge a block of iron/steel with a hole (eye) for the handle.
    - **Wood:** A heavy knot or burl of hard wood (for a mallet).
2.  **Preparation:**
    - If stone, peck a groove around the middle to prevent the lashing from slipping (grooved axe/hammer style).
3.  **Handle:** Select a resilient wooden branch (hickory or ash) that absorbs shock.
4.  **Assembly:**
    - **Lashing (Stone):** Split the end of the handle or place the stone against it, then wrap tightly with wet rawhide or sinew. As it dries, it shrinks and tightens.
    - **Wedging (Metal):** Insert the handle into the eye and drive a small wooden or metal wedge into the top of the handle to expand it and lock the head in place.
5.  **Technical level:** Basic (Stone) to Intermediate (Metal).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Head:** Stone, Metal, or Hardwood.
  - **Handle:** Shock-absorbing wood.
  - **Binding:** Rawhide, sinew, or rope (for stone hammers).
- **Tools:** Abrasive stones (for grooving), Knife.

## Variants and improvements

- **Mallet:** A large wooden hammer used for driving chisels or assembling furniture without damaging the surface.
- **Sledgehammer:** A large, heavy hammer requiring two hands, used for destruction or heavy forging.
- **Claw Hammer:** Features a fork on the back of the head for pulling nails.
- **Trip Hammer:** A powered hammer for industrial forging.

## Limits and risks

- **Recoil:** Striking a hard surface can transmit shock to the wrist and arm.
- **Safety:** The head can fly off if not securely fastened.
- **Accuracy:** Requires practice to hit the target squarely without damaging the workpiece or fingers.
