# Brief description

A magnet is an object or material that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt.

## Use / Function

- **Energy Conversion:** Essential component in electric motors and generators.
- **Navigation:** The core component of a compass for finding direction.
- **Separation:** Sorting ferrous metals from non-ferrous waste or ore.
- **Holding/Fastening:** Using magnetic force to hold objects together without screws or glue.

## Operating principle

Magnets work due to the alignment of magnetic domains within the material (ferromagnetism) or through the movement of electric charges (electromagnetism). In permanent magnets, the atomic magnetic moments are aligned in a consistent direction.

## How to create it

1.  **Stroking Method (Weak):** Take a piece of steel (like a needle) and stroke it repeatedly with a natural lodestone (magnetite) in **one direction only**. This aligns the domains.
2.  **Electrical Method (Strong):** Wrap an insulated copper wire around a steel rod to form a coil. Connect the wire ends to a battery (DC source) for a short time. The strong magnetic field from the current will permanently magnetize the steel.
3.  **Electromagnet (Temporary):** Wrap wire around a soft iron core and pass current through it. It acts as a magnet only while the current flows.

## Materials needed

- **Ferromagnetic Material:** Iron or Steel (Steel retains magnetism better than soft iron).
- **Source of Magnetism:** A Lodestone (Magnetite) or an electric current (Battery + Wire).
- **Wire:** For the electrical method.

## Variants and improvements

- **Permanent Magnet:** Retains magnetism for a long time (made of hard steel or special alloys).
- **Electromagnet:** Can be turned on and off; strength depends on current and turns of wire.
- **Horseshoe Magnet:** Bent into a U-shape to bring the two poles closer, concentrating the magnetic field.

## Limits and risks

- **Demagnetization:** Heat (Curie temperature) or strong physical shock (hammering) can randomize the domains and destroy the magnetism.
- **Rust:** Iron magnets can rust if not protected.
- **Interference:** Strong magnets can damage sensitive electronics or erase magnetic storage.
