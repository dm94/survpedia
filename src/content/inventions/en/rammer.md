# Brief description

A simple tool used to compact soil, gravel, or other loose materials by repeated impact. It is essential for creating stable foundations for roads and buildings.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Compacting earth and base layers for construction.
- **Secondary uses:** Packing post holes, making adobe floors, paving.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

- **Compaction:** Repeated impacts force air pockets out of the soil/gravel mix, pushing particles closer together.
- **Density:** Increased density leads to higher load-bearing capacity and reduced water permeability.

## How to create it

1.  **Simple Log Rammer:**
    - Find a heavy log (15-20 cm diameter).
    - Smooth one end flat (the face).
    - Carve a handle or attach a crossbar handle to the top.
2.  **Stone/Metal Rammer:**
    - **Head:** Use a heavy flat stone or cast an iron block.
    - **Handle:** Attach a long vertical wooden handle to the center of the weight.
3.  **Operation:** Lift the rammer vertically and drop it onto the surface. Let gravity do the work; guide it, don't force it down.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Weight:** Heavy wood, stone, or iron.
  - **Handle:** Smooth wood to prevent blisters.
- **Tools:**
  - **Saw/Axe:** For shaping the log.
  - **Drill:** If attaching a handle to a separate head.

## Variants and improvements

- **Earth Rammer (Punner):** Usually a square cast-iron head on a wooden shaft.
- **Paving Rammer:** Often has a wooden face to avoid cracking stones.
- **Mechanical Rammer:** Motorized "jumping jack" for modern construction.

## Limits and risks

- **Physical Exertion:** Very tiring to use for long periods.
- **Vibration:** Can cause hand/arm fatigue.
- **Foot Safety:** High risk of crushing toes if dropped.
