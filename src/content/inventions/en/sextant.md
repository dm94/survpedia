# Brief description

Optical navigation instrument used to measure the angle between two visible objects. Its primary use is measuring the angle between a celestial body and the horizon to determine latitude.

## Use / Function

- **Navigation:** Determine latitude by measuring the height of the sun or a star above the horizon.
- **Surveying:** Measure horizontal angles between reference points.

## Operating principle

Uses the principle of **double reflection**.

1. A movable mirror (index) reflects the celestial object's image to a fixed mirror (horizon).
2. The horizon mirror is semi-transparent: allows seeing the horizon directly through it and seeing the star's reflection superimposed.
3. When aligning both images, the index mirror's angle indicates the star's height.

## How to create it

1. **Frame:** A 60-degree circular sector (one-sixth of a circle).
2. **Index Arm:** A movable arm with a mirror at the pivot.
3. **Mirrors:** Two small flat mirrors.
4. **Scale:** A precisely graduated arc.
5. **Sight:** A small tube or hole for aligning the view.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Brass or bronze (stable and marine corrosion resistant), glass for mirrors.
- **Tools:** Precision engraving tools for the scale.

## Variants and improvements

- **Octant:** Earlier version with a 45-degree arc (one-eighth of a circle).
- **Vernier:** Auxiliary scale to increase reading precision.

## Limits and risks

- **Visibility:** Requires seeing both the star and the horizon (difficult on cloudy days or moonless nights).
- **Instrumental Error:** Must be adjusted and verified regularly.
