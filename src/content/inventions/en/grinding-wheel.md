# Brief description

A grinding wheel is a wheel composed of abrasive compound used for various grinding (abrasive cutting) and abrasive machining operations. It is essential for sharpening the cutting tools used in **[Lathes](/en/inventions/lathe)**, **[Milling Machines](/en/inventions/milling-machine)**, and **[Drills](/en/inventions/drill-press)**.

## Use / Function

- **Sharpening:** Restoring the cutting edge of chisels, **[Drill Bits](/en/inventions/drill-bit)**, **[Milling Cutters](/en/inventions/milling-cutter)**, and **[Lathe Tools](/en/inventions/lathe-tool)**.
- **Smoothing:** Removing rough edges from castings or forgings.
- **Precision Grinding:** Achieving high-precision dimensions and surface finishes on hardened steel parts.
- **Cutting:** Thin wheels (cutoff wheels) can slice through metal.

## Operating principle

The wheel consists of abrasive grains held together by a bonding agent. As the wheel rotates at high speed against the workpiece, the sharp edges of the grains cut away small chips of material. As grains become dull, the bond breaks down to release them and expose fresh, sharp grains (self-sharpening).

## How to create it

### Primitive version (Sandstone)

1.  **Selection:** Find a fine-grained, uniform sandstone rock.
2.  **Shaping:** Carve it into a circular disk with a central hole.
3.  **Mounting:** Mount it on an axle and rotate it (pedal or crank power) through a water trough to keep it cool.

### Advanced version (Vitrified Bond)

1.  **Abrasive:** Crush and sieve hard material (**[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, **[Emery](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Corundum](/en/materials/ruby)**) to a specific grain size.
2.  **Mixing:** Mix with a bonding agent (usually **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** and feldspar).
3.  **Molding:** Press the mixture into a mold under high pressure.
4.  **Firing:** Fire in a **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)** at high temperature to vitrify (turn to glass) the bond.
5.  **Truing:** Dress the wheel with a harder stone or diamond to ensure it is perfectly round.

## Materials needed

- **Abrasive:**
  - **Natural:** Sandstone, Emery, Corundum, Garnet.
  - **Synthetic:** Silicon Carbide (Sand + Coke in electric furnace), Aluminum Oxide.
- **Bond:** Clay (Vitrified), Shellac, Rubber, Resin.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bench Grinder:** Motorized, double-ended grinder for general sharpening.
- **Surface Grinder:** Precision machine for flat surfaces.
- **Cylindrical Grinder:** For precision shafts.
- **Cutoff Wheel:** Thin, resin-bonded wheel for cutting metal.

## Limits and risks

- **Explosion:** A cracked wheel spinning at high speed can explode with lethal force. Always "ring test" a wheel before mounting.
- **Heat:** Grinding generates intense heat which can ruin the temper of steel tools. Dip in water frequently.
- **Dust:** Silica dust causes silicosis. Wear a mask.
