# Brief description

A ruler is a tool used to measure lengths and draw straight lines. It is a fundamental instrument in geometry, technical drawing, engineering, and construction.

## Use / Function

- **Measurement:** Determining the length of an object or distance.
- **Drawing:** Guiding a pen or pencil to draw straight lines.
- **Cutting:** Providing a straight edge for cutting materials.
- **Scale:** Personal to small-scale construction.

## Operating principle

It works by **direct comparison**. The ruler has markings (graduations) that represent standard units of length (centimeters, inches). By aligning the object with the ruler, its length can be read directly.

## How to create it

1.  **Material Selection:** Choose a rigid, straight material (hardwood, metal strip).
2.  **Straightening:** Plane one edge until it is perfectly straight.
3.  **Marking:** Using a known standard, mark equal intervals along the edge.
4.  **Finishing:** Ensure markings are clear and durable.

- **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Hardwood, metal, or rigid plastic.
- **Tools:** Planer, scribe or fine pen, standard reference for calibration.

## Variants and improvements

- **Folding ruler:** Hinged sections for portability.
- **Scale ruler:** Multiple scales for reading architectural drawings.
- **Steel rule:** High precision for machining.

## Limits and risks

- **Length:** Limited by the physical length of the ruler.
- **Parallax:** Reading from an angle can cause errors.
- **Wear:** Markings can fade or the edge can become damaged.
