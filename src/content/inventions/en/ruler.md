# Brief description

A straight strip of plastic, wood, metal, or other rigid material, marked at regular intervals, used to draw straight lines or measure distances.

## Use / Function

- **Measurement**: Measuring length.
- **Drawing**: Guiding straight lines.
- **Scale**: Used in domestic, educational, and industrial settings.

## Operating principle

Direct comparison against a standard scale marked on the tool. The user aligns the zero mark with the start of the object and reads the value at the end.

## How to create it

1.  **Body**: Find a straight branch or split a log. Plane it flat and straight. Alternatively, cut a strip of metal or bone.
2.  **Marking**: Use a known standard (e.g., thumb width, foot, or another ruler) to mark intervals. Carve notches or paint lines. Ensure spacing is consistent.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Wood, Bone, or Metal (Steel, Brass, Iron).
- **Tools**: Knife, Saw, Plane, Marking tool (scribe or paint).

## Variants and improvements

- **Tape Measure**: Flexible for measuring curves.
- **Folding Ruler**: Compact storage.
- **Caliper**: For more precise internal/external measurements.
- **Triangular Scale**: Multiple scales on one ruler.

## Limits and risks

- **Precision**: Limited by the thickness of the markings and the visual acuity of the user.
- **Thermal Expansion**: Metal rulers expand with heat, affecting accuracy.
- **Warping**: Wood rulers can warp with humidity.
- **Length**: Not suitable for measuring long distances (use a tape measure or chain) or very small objects (use a caliper or micrometer).
