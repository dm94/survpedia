# Brief description

A tool for drawing corks from bottles. It consists of a pointed metallic helix (a screw) attached to a handle.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Removing cork stoppers from wine or oil bottles without damaging the container.
- **Scale**: Domestic.

## Operating principle

The corkscrew works by screwing the helical worm into the cork, gripping it from the inside. Then, pulling force (direct or leveraged) extracts the cork against friction.
- **Helix (Screw)**: Acts as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, allowing it to penetrate the cork with rotation.
- **Grip**: The threads hold the cork material firmly.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Worm**: Twist a steel wire into a helix shape, ensuring the tip is sharp and centered.
2.  **Handle**: Attach a perpendicular handle (wood or metal) to the top of the wire.
3.  **Hardening**: The wire must be stiff enough not to straighten out when pulling.

### Technical level
- **Intermediate**: Creating a consistent helix that doesn't crumble the cork requires skill in wire bending and tempering.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Steel Wire**: Strong, springy steel that holds its shape.
    - **Handle**: Wood or metal.
- **Tools**:
    - **Pliers/Mandrel**: To wind the wire into a consistent spiral.
    - **Heat Source**: To temper the steel.

## Variants and improvements

- **T-Handle**: Simple pull.
- **Waiter's Friend (Sommelier Knife)**: Includes a lever arm that rests on the bottle lip to pry the cork out easily.
- **Winged Corkscrew**: Uses two levers (wings) and a rack-and-pinion gear to lift the cork as the wings are pushed down.
- **Ah-So (Prong Puller)**: Two prongs slide down the sides of the cork to grip it without piercing.

## Limits and risks

- **Cork Breakage**: If the worm is too thick or the cork is dry, it may crumble or break in half.
- **Bottle Breakage**: Applying too much side pressure or leverage on the glass rim can chip or shatter the bottle.
