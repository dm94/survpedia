# Brief description

A small protective cap worn on the finger to push a needle through tough material without injury. It is an essential tool for sewing and tailoring.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Protecting the finger (usually the middle finger) while pushing a needle.
- **Secondary uses**: Sometimes used as a measuring volume for small amounts of liquid (hence "thimbleful").
- **Scale**: Individual tool.

## Operating Principle

A thimble works as a shield. The hard material (metal, bone) distributes the point force of the needle's eye end over the fingertip, preventing it from piercing the skin. The dimples on the surface prevent the needle from slipping.

## How to create it

### Primitive Version (Leather)
1.  **Cut**: Cut a strip of thick leather.
2.  **Sew**: Sew it into a ring or cap shape to fit the finger.

### Advanced Version (Metal)
1.  **Form**: Shape a small disk of metal into a cup using a die or hammer.
2.  **Dimple**: Punch small indentations (dimples) on the closed end to catch the needle.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**: For flexible, simple thimbles.
  - **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: For carved thimbles.
  - **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, or **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)**: For durable metal thimbles.

## Variants and improvements

- **Open-top Thimble**: Used by tailors (tailor's thimble) for better ventilation and control.
- **Ring Thimble**: Just a ring with dimples, used in some cultures.
- **Palm Thimble**: Used for heavy sailmaking, worn on the palm.

## Limits and risks

- **Fit**: Must fit well; too loose falls off, too tight cuts circulation.
- **Wear**: Metal needles can eventually wear through softer thimbles (leather, wood).
