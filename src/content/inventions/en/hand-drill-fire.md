# Brief description

Hand drill fire is a friction method that uses bare hands to spin a wooden spindle against a hearth board until an ember forms.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Create a live ember for fire starting.
- **Secondary uses:** Train material selection and firemaking skills.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

Rapid rotation creates friction heat at the contact point. Fine wood dust collects in a notch, heats up, and carbonizes into a glowing ember that can be transferred to tinder.

## How to create it

1. **Select wood:** Soft hearth board (cedar, poplar) and a slightly harder spindle.
2. **Prepare the socket:** Make a small depression in the hearth board.
3. **Cut the notch:** Create a V-shaped notch from the edge into the socket to collect dust.
4. **Spin:** Roll the spindle between your palms with steady pressure until smoke and a dark dust pile appear.
5. **Ember:** Keep spinning until the dust glows. Transfer the ember to a tinder bundle and blow gently.
6. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Dry hearth board, straight spindle, tinder bundle.
- **Tools:** Knife or sharp stone for shaping and notching.
- **Substitutes:** A bow drill for easier rotation and less fatigue.

## Variants and improvements

- **Two-person drill:** One person spins while the other steadies the spindle.
- **Pre-scored notch:** Reduces slipping and speeds ember formation.
- **Drying prep:** Warming wood near a fire improves reliability.

## Limits and risks

- **High effort:** Requires strength and endurance.
- **Moisture sensitivity:** Damp wood fails quickly.
- **Blisters:** Sustained friction can injure hands.
