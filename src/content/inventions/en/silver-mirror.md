# Brief description

A silver mirror is a type of modern mirror that uses a thin layer of metallic silver deposited onto a glass substrate through a chemical process. It is the most common type of domestic mirror due to its high reflectivity and clarity.

## Use / Function

Its primary purpose is to provide a high-quality reflection for various applications:

- **Domestic:** Grooming, dressing, and interior decoration to enhance light and space.
- **Precision Optics:** Used in scientific instruments, although often replaced by aluminized mirrors for specific wavelengths.
- **Architectural:** Cladding and decorative panels in buildings.
- **Scale:** Mass-produced, domestic and commercial use.

## Operating principle

The silver mirror operates on the principle of **chemical silvering** (the Tollens' reaction):

- **Chemical Precipitation:** Silver nitrate in an aqueous solution is reduced to metallic silver by a reducing agent (like glucose).
- **Adhesion:** The silver atoms precipitate out of the solution and bond directly to a sensitized glass surface.
- **Specular Reflection:** The resulting thin, uniform layer of silver is extremely smooth, allowing for nearly perfect specular reflection of visible light.

## How to create it

Creating a silver mirror is an advanced chemical process that requires precision:

1.  **Preparation:** A sheet of high-quality **[glass](/en/materials/glass)** is meticulously cleaned to remove all oils and impurities.
2.  **Sensitization:** The glass is treated with a tin(II) chloride solution, which acts as a "bridge" to help the silver adhere.
3.  **Silvering:** A solution of silver nitrate and ammonia is mixed with a reducing solution (glucose or formaldehyde) and poured over the glass.
4.  **Backing:** After the silver layer forms and dries, it is covered with a layer of copper (optional) and then a layer of protective paint to prevent oxidation and physical damage.

- **Technical Level:** Advanced (requires handling of specific chemicals and a controlled environment).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **[Glass](/en/materials/glass):** Flat, high-quality substrate.
  - **Silver Nitrate:** The source of silver.
  - **Ammonia:** To keep the silver in solution.
  - **Glucose:** Reducing agent.
  - **Tin(II) Chloride:** Sensitizer.
  - **Distilled Water:** For pure solutions.
- **Tools:** Level pouring table, sprayers or containers for chemicals, protective gear (gloves, goggles).
- **Possible Substitutes:** Aluminum (applied via vacuum deposition) for industrial mirrors, or mercury amalgams (antique and toxic).

## Variants and improvements

- **Mercury Mirrors:** The predecessor to silver mirrors, using a toxic tin-mercury amalgam.
- **Copper-Free Mirrors:** Modern improvement that eliminates the copper layer to reduce environmental impact and improve corrosion resistance.
- **First-Surface Mirrors:** The silver is on the front of the glass (used in optics) to avoid ghosting images, but it is very fragile.

## Limits and risks

- **Oxidation (Black Edge):** If moisture reaches the silver layer, it can oxidize, creating dark spots or "rot" at the edges.
- **Fragility:** Like all glass products, it is prone to breaking and thermal shock.
- **Chemical Safety:** Silver nitrate can stain skin and surfaces; ammonia fumes are irritating.
- **Ghosting:** In standard second-surface mirrors, a faint secondary reflection occurs from the front surface of the glass.
