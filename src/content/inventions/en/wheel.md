# Brief description

A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. It is one of the key components of the wheel and axle, one of the six simple machines.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** Moving goods and people with significantly reduced friction.
- **Pottery:** The potter's wheel for creating symmetrical vessels.
- **Machinery:** Gears and pulleys in complex mechanical systems.
- **Milling:** Using large stones to grind grain.
- **Water Wheels:** Converting the flow of water into rotational energy.

## Operating principle

The wheel reduces friction by substituting rolling motion for sliding motion. By using an axle, it also allows for the transfer of torque, where a small force applied to the rim can overcome a large resistance at the axle, or vice versa.

## How to create it

1.  **Disc creation:** Cut a circular disc from a hard material like wood or stone.
2.  **Axle hole:** Drill a perfectly centered hole in the disc.
3.  **Axle fabrication:** Create a cylindrical rod (axle) that fits through the hole.
4.  **Assembly:** Mount the wheel on the axle, ensuring it can rotate freely but with minimal wobble.
5.  **Lubrication:** Apply animal fat or oil to the axle to further reduce friction.

## Materials needed

- **Wheel body:** Hardwood (oak, ash) or durable stone.
- **Axle:** Sturdy wood or metal.
- **Fasteners:** Pins or wedges to keep the wheel on the axle.
- **Lubricant:** Grease or oil.

## Variants and improvements

- **Solid wheel:** Made from a single piece or joined planks.
- **Spoked wheel:** Lighter and faster, uses less material while maintaining strength.
- **Pneumatic tire:** Modern improvement using rubber and compressed air for cushioning.
- **Gears:** Toothed wheels for transmitting power between shafts.

## Limits and risks

- **Terrain:** Requires relatively flat or prepared surfaces (roads).
- **Alignment:** An off-center axle causes vibration and inefficiency.
- **Wear:** Constant friction at the axle eventually wears down the components.
