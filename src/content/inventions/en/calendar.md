# Brief description

A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to coordinate activities and track the passage of time over long periods:

- **Agriculture:** Determining the best times for planting and harvesting based on seasons.
- **Civil Administration:** Scheduling taxes, contracts, and public events.
- **Religious/Cultural:** Tracking festivals, holidays, and ritual cycles.
- **History/Astronomy:** Recording past events and predicting astronomical phenomena (eclipses, solstices).

## Operating principle

Calendars are usually synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon:

- **Solar calendars:** Based on the Earth's rotation around the Sun (approx. 365.24 days). The seasons stay in the same months.
- **Lunar calendars:** Based on the cycles of the Moon phases (approx. 29.5 days per month). A lunar year is about 354 days.
- **Lunisolar calendars:** Combine both, adding extra months (intercalary months) to align the lunar months with the solar year.

The core principle is **periodic observation and correction**. Since astronomical cycles are not whole numbers of days, intercalation (like leap years) is required to keep the calendar aligned with the seasons.

## How to create it

1.  **Define the Unit:** Determine what constitutes a "day" (sunrise to sunrise, or sunset to sunset).
2.  **Establish Reference Points:**
    - **Solar:** Mark the point on the horizon where the sun rises. The extreme north and south points are the **solstices**. The midpoint is the **equinox**.
    - **Lunar:** Observe the new moon.
3.  **Count and Record:** Use tally marks (on bone, wood, or stone) to count days between these events.
4.  **Structure:** Group days into larger units (months based on the moon, years based on the sun).
5.  **Correction:** If the seasons start drifting (e.g., winter harvest comes too early), add days or months to realign the system.

## Materials needed

-   **Observation Tools:**
    -   **Stone/Wood:** For building fixed markers (like Stonehenge or simple sighting posts) to track the sun's position.
-   **Recording Media:**
    -   **Clay/Stone:** For permanent, durable records (tablets, stelae).
    -   **Papyrus/Parchment/Paper:** For portable, administrative calendars.
    -   **Ink/Stylus:** For marking the dates.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Tally Sticks:** Simple notched bones or sticks to count moon cycles (Paleolithic).
-   **Megalithic Calendars:** Stone circles aligned with solstices (Neolithic).
-   **Julian Calendar:** Introduced a regular leap year every 4 years (Solar).
-   **Gregorian Calendar:** Refined the leap year rule (skipping some centurial years) to be more accurate to the solar year (Modern standard).
-   **Perpetual Calendar:** Algorithms or devices that allow finding the day of the week for any given date.

## Limits and risks

-   **Drift:** Without precise intercalation, a calendar will drift relative to the seasons, causing agricultural failure if used blindly.
-   **Complexity:** Lunisolar systems require complex math and observation to determine when to add extra months.
-   **Political Control:** Historically, rulers often controlled the calendar (and thus the festivals and taxes), sometimes manipulating it for political gain.
