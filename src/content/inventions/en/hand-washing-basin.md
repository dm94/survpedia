# Brief description

A bowl-shaped fixture used for washing hands, face, and small objects. It is a critical component of personal hygiene and sanitation, acting as the interface between the clean water supply and the user.

## Use / Function

- **Personal Hygiene:** Washing hands to remove pathogens, dirt, and chemicals.
- **Disease Prevention:** The primary defense against fecal-oral transmission of diseases.
- **Water Containment:** Holds water temporarily for use before draining it away.
- **Scale:** Domestic to public.

## Operating principle

1.  **Supply:** Water is delivered to the basin via a faucet or spout, connected to the **[Water Supply](/en/inventions/water-supply)**.
2.  **Retention:** The concave shape holds a volume of water.
3.  **Drainage:** A hole at the lowest point allows used water to exit into the **[Sewage System](/en/inventions/sewage-system)** via gravity.
4.  **Trap:** A curved pipe (P-trap) below the drain holds a small amount of water to seal off sewer gases.

## How to create it

1.  **Basin Formation:** Carve a bowl from stone, mold it from clay and fire it (**[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics)**), or cast it from metal/concrete. Ideally, the surface should be smooth and non-porous to prevent bacterial growth.
2.  **Drain Hole:** Create a hole at the bottom.
3.  **Mounting:** Place the basin on a pedestal, mount it to a wall, or set it into a countertop.
4.  **Plumbing Connection:** Connect the water source (faucet/pitcher) above and the drain pipe below.
5.  **Seal:** Ensure the drain connection is watertight using gaskets or putty.

### Required technological level
Basic (manual pouring) to Intermediate (plumbed).

## Materials needed

- **Basin:** **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics)** (glazed), **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** (granite, marble), **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)** (stainless steel, copper), or **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)**.
- **Plumbing:** **[Pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)** for supply and drain.
- **Sealant:** **[Natural Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)**, putty, or silicone.

## Variants and improvements

- **Washstand:** A simple bowl on a stand, filled manually from a pitcher.
- **Pedestal Sink:** A freestanding basin supported by a column that hides the pipes.
- **Vanity Sink:** Set into a cabinet for storage.
- **Automatic Faucet:** Uses sensors to reduce contact and save water.

## Limits and risks

- **Clogging:** Hair, soap scum, and objects can block the drain.
- **Overflow:** If the drain is blocked or water is left running, it can flood the area (unless an overflow hole is present).
- **Contamination:** A dirty basin can become a breeding ground for bacteria if not cleaned.
- **Leaks:** Connections can leak, causing water damage.
