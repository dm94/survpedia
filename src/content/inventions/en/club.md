# Brief description

A club is among the simplest of all weapons: a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a bludgeoning weapon. It is effective, easy to make, and requires little maintenance.

## Use / Function

- **Combat**: Delivers blunt force trauma to an opponent.
- **Hunting**: Used to dispatch small game or finish off wounded prey.
- **Tool**: Can be used for breaking things (nuts, bones, ice).

## Operating principle

The club acts as a lever. The hand acts as the fulcrum. By swinging the club, the heavy end travels faster than the hand, accumulating kinetic energy. Upon impact, this energy is transferred to the target, causing damage through crushing rather than cutting.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection**: Find a piece of hardwood (oak, hickory) that is comfortable to grip but heavy at one end. A root ball or a large knot makes an excellent striking head.
2.  **Shaping**: Whittle the handle to fit your hand comfortably. Remove bark and rough spots to prevent blisters.
3.  **Hardening**: Optionally, fire-harden the head by lightly charring it over a fire to remove moisture and increase density.

## Materials needed

- **Wood**: Heavy, dense hardwood is best.
- **Stone (Optional)**: Can be inserted or tied to the head for extra weight/damage (Stone Club).

## Variants and improvements

- **Cudgel**: A short, thick stick.
- **Mace**: A club with a heavy metal or stone head.
- **Spiked Club**: Thorns, obsidian flakes, or nails driven into the head to add piercing damage.
- **Quarterstaff**: A long club used with two hands for reach and defense.

## Limits and risks

- **Range**: Requires close combat (melee range).
- **Speed**: Heavy clubs can be slow to swing and recover.
- **Durability**: Wood can rot or split if not cared for.
