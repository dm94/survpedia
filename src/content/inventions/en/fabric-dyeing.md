# Brief description

Fabric dyeing is the process of permanently coloring textiles by bonding dye molecules to the fibers. Unlike paint, dyes penetrate the fabric structure, and brushes can be used to apply thickened dye for localized patterns.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Color clothing, textiles, and yarns.
- **Secondary uses**: Decorative patterns, camouflage, and status signaling.
- **Scale**: Domestic to workshop.

## Operating principle

Heat, water, and mordants open fiber structures and create chemical bonds with dye molecules. Agitation and time control how evenly the dye penetrates, while pH modifiers shift final hues.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

1.  Heat water in a non-reactive pot.
2.  Add plant-based dye material and simmer to extract color.
3.  Pre-wet the fabric, then immerse and stir.
4.  Rinse until water runs mostly clear and dry.

### Essential steps

1.  **Scour**: Wash fabric to remove oils and sizing.
2.  **Mordant**: Soak in **[alum](/en/materials/alum)** solution for better permanence.
3.  **Prepare dye bath**: Extract dye in hot water and strain solids.
4.  **Dye**: Simmer fabric while stirring for even color.
5.  **Rinse and dry**: Rinse, then air-dry away from direct sun.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**
  - **[Textile Dye](/en/materials/textile-dye)** or dye plants
  - **[Water](/en/materials/water)**
  - **[Alum](/en/materials/alum)** or other mordants
- **Tools**: Pots/vats, stirring sticks, tongs, heat source, drying line.
- **Possible substitutes**:
  - **Smoke**: For yellow-brown tones and water resistance.
  - **Stains**: Berry juices for short-lived colors.
  - **Pigment paint**: **[Paint](/en/materials/paint)** for surface color without fiber bonding.

## Variants and improvements

- **Immersion dyeing**: Full-bath dyeing for even color.
- **Resist dyeing**: Tie-dye or wax resist for patterns.
- **Brush dyeing**: Apply thickened dye with a **[brush](/en/inventions/brush)** for motifs.
- **Vat dyeing**: Indigo or other reduction dyes for deep blues.

## Limits and risks

- **Uneven color**: Poor stirring or crowded fabric causes blotching.
- **Fading**: Some natural dyes are light-sensitive.
- **Bleeding**: Excess dye or weak mordanting stains other fabrics.
- **Burns and fumes**: Hot liquids and some mordants are hazardous.
