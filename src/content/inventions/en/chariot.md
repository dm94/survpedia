# Brief description

A fast, lightweight, two-wheeled vehicle drawn by horses. Historically used for warfare, hunting, and racing. It represents the pinnacle of ancient mobile engineering, combining speed and maneuverability.

## Use / Function

- **Warfare:** Used as a mobile archery platform or for shock tactics.
- **Transportation:** Rapid transport for messengers or nobility.
- **Racing:** A popular sport in ancient civilizations.

## Operating principle

The chariot relies on a lightweight design and the power of horses.

- **Speed:** By minimizing weight and using spoked [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel), the horses can pull the vehicle at high speeds.
- **Stability:** A wide [axle](/en/inventions/axle) track provides stability during sharp turns.

## How to create it

1.  **Platform:** Construct a light wooden floor with a low semi-circular guard at the front.
2.  **Axle:** Mount a strong [axle](/en/inventions/axle) at the very rear of the platform to maximize stability and maneuverability (though this increases the weight on the horses).
3.  **Wheels:** Attach two spoked [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel). Solid wheels are too heavy for a war chariot.
4.  **Draft Pole:** Attach a long pole to the center of the axle/frame, extending forward to the horses' yoke.
5.  **Yoke:** Connect the pole to the horses using a [yoke](/en/inventions/yoke) and [leather](/en/materials/leather) straps.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Light but strong [wood](/en/materials/wood) (ash, elm) for the frame and wheels.
- **Leather:** For suspension (floor weaving) and harnessing.
- **Metal:** [Bronze](/en/materials/bronze) or [iron](/en/materials/iron) for axle pins and wheel tires.

## Variants and improvements

- **Scythe Chariot:** Fitted with blades on the wheels to cut down infantry.
- **Quadriga:** A chariot drawn by four horses.
- **Cart:** A heavier, slower version for transport (see [Cart](/en/inventions/cart)).

## Limits and risks

- **Terrain:** Requires flat, open ground. Useless in forests or rocky terrain.
- **Skill:** Requires a highly skilled driver (charioteer) and trained horses.
- **Fragility:** Light construction makes it vulnerable to breaking upon impact.
