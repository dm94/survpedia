# Brief description

A splint is a rigid support that immobilizes an injured limb to reduce pain, prevent further damage, and allow healing.

## Use / Function

- **Immobilization:** Keep bones and joints still after fractures or sprains.
- **Protection:** Prevent movements that worsen soft tissue damage.
- **Transport:** Enable safer movement of an injured person.
- **Support:** Maintain basic alignment while swelling decreases.

## Operating principle

It combines **rigidity**, **padding**, and **fixation**. The splint blocks motion at the injured area and the joints above and below it, while padding distributes pressure and protects the skin.

## How to create it

1. **Choose rigid supports:** Two straight pieces of **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, bark, or bone.
2. **Add padding:** Wrap with **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, dry leaves, or soft fibers.
3. **Position without forcing:** Keep the limb in a natural position and place the supports on both sides.
4. **Secure:** Tie with fabric strips, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**, or cordage from **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**.
5. **Check circulation:** Look for color, temperature, and sensation. Loosen if numbness appears.
6. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Rigid supports (wood, bark, or bone), padding, strong ties.
- **Tools:** Knife, scissors, or sharp stone for cutting.
- **Substitutes:** Straight branches, walking sticks, pack frames, rolled clothing.

## Variants and improvements

- **Double splint:** Two parallel slats for higher stiffness.
- **Soft splint:** Thick padding and ties for minor injuries.
- **Long splint:** Immobilizes an entire leg or arm for long transports.
- **Adjustable splint:** Sliding knots to adapt to swelling.

## Limits and risks

- **Excess pressure:** Can cut circulation or compress nerves.
- **Bad alignment:** Can worsen a fracture.
- **Poor padding:** Causes pressure sores and blisters.
- **No re-checks:** Swelling changes over time; reassess regularly.
