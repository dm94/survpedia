# Brief description

A simple boat is a watercraft constructed from wooden planks or boards, joined together to form a hull. Unlike a raft (which relies on material buoyancy) or a dugout canoe (carved from a single log), a simple boat relies on water displacement by a watertight hollow hull for buoyancy.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** Carrying passengers and cargo over longer distances than canoes.
- **Fishing:** Enabling fishing in deeper waters or further from shore.
- **Trade:** Facilitating commerce between coastal or river communities.

## Operating principle

**Displacement:** The boat is designed to displace a volume of water that weighs more than the boat and its cargo. The upward buoyant force equals the weight of the water displaced.
**Hydrodynamics:** The hull is shaped to cut through water with minimal resistance (drag) while maintaining stability.

## How to create it

1. **Keel Laying:** Lay down a strong central beam (keel) which serves as the spine of the boat.
2. **Framing:** Attach curved ribs or frames to the keel to define the shape of the hull.
3. **Planking:** Attach wooden planks to the frames (carvel) or overlapping each other (clinker) to form the outer shell.
4. **Caulking:** Fill the gaps between planks with fibrous material (like hemp or oakum) soaked in pitch or resin to make the hull watertight.
5. **Outfitting:** Add seats (thwarts), oarlocks for [[oar|Oars]], or a mast for a [[sail|Sail]].

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Planks for the hull (cedar, oak, pine) and strong timber for the keel/frames.
- **Fasteners:** Wooden pegs (treenails), copper/iron nails, or strong rope lashing.
- **Sealant:** Pitch, tar, or resin mixed with fibers for caulking.
- **Tools:** Saws, axes, augers, hammers, adzes.

## Variants and improvements

- **Rowboat:** Propelled primarily by oars.
- **Sailboat:** Fitted with a mast and sail for wind propulsion.
- **Dory:** A flat-bottomed boat with high sides, good for launching from beaches.

## Limits and risks

- **Leakage:** Requires constant maintenance to keep caulking intact; a leak can sink the boat.
- **Capsizing:** Can tip over in rough seas if not properly handled or ballasted.
- **Rot:** Wood will rot if not treated or kept dry when not in use.
