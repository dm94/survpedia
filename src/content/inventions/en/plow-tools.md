# Brief description

Plow and tools are a basic agricultural toolkit used to break soil, open furrows, and manage fields for planting and harvest. The plow handles heavy soil work, while hand tools handle precision tasks.

## Use / Function

- **Soil preparation:** Break and turn soil to aerate and mix organic matter.
- **Furrowing:** Create straight rows for sowing and irrigation.
- **Weed control:** Cut or uproot weeds between rows.
- **Harvest support:** Lift tubers and loosen soil for gathering.
- **Scale:** Household to community fields.

## Operating principle

- **Plow share + moldboard:** A wedge cuts soil and a curved surface flips it.
- **Draft force:** Human or animal traction converts pulling into forward motion and soil turnover.
- **Hand tools:** Leverage and wedge edges allow controlled cutting and lifting.

## How to create it

1. **Build a beam and handles:** Shape a strong wooden beam with a grip for steering.
2. **Add a share:** Attach a stone or metal blade at the front to cut soil.
3. **Set the angle:** Tilt the share so it bites and lifts instead of skipping.
4. **Make a hitch:** Use **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** straps for a human or animal yoke.
5. **Finish hand tools:** Create simple hoes and rakes from wood with stone or metal edges.
6. **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate (metal share and yoke increase efficiency).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frame, share of **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, bindings of **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**.
- **Tools:** **[Stone tools](/en/inventions/stone-tools)** or metal tools for shaping, plus **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)** for clearing.
- **Substitutes:** Digging stick or shallow scratch plow for light soils.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ard (scratch plow):** Simple wooden plow for light soils.
- **Moldboard plow:** Turns soil completely, better weed control.
- **Iron share and coulter:** Cuts harder soils and reduces wear.
- **Animal-drawn plow:** Faster and deeper tillage.

## Limits and risks

- **Soil damage:** Over-tillage can cause erosion and moisture loss.
- **Stone breakage:** Rocky ground chips shares and bends frames.
- **Power needs:** Requires steady draft power and skill to guide.
- **Injury risk:** Heavy loads and sharp edges can cause strain or cuts.
