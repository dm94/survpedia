# Brief description

A device or setup used to remove impurities, sediment, and pathogens from water to make it safe for drinking or other uses.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Producing potable water from contaminated sources.
- **Secondary uses:** Pre-treatment for industrial processes.
- **Scale:** Individual (portable) to municipal (sand beds).

## Operating principle

- **Mechanical Filtration:** Layers of different pore sizes trap particles.
  - **Gravel/Stones:** Catch large debris.
  - **Sand:** Catches smaller sediments and organisms.
  - **Cloth/Ceramic:** Catches very fine particles.
- **Adsorption:** **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** (activated carbon) absorbs chemicals, odors, and toxins.
- **Biological Action:** In slow sand filters, a "schmutzdecke" (biological layer) forms on top, where microorganisms consume pathogens.

## How to create it

**Bio-Sand Filter (Household):**

1.  **Container:** Use a tall barrel or bucket with a tap at the bottom.
2.  **Drainage Layer:** Place a layer of clean **[gravel](/en/materials/gravel)** at the bottom to cover the outlet.
3.  **Separation:** Place a mesh or **[fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** over the gravel to prevent mixing.
4.  **Filtration Layer:** Fill the bulk of the container with fine, washed **[sand](/en/materials/sand)**.
5.  **Adsorption Layer (Optional):** Add a layer of crushed **[charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for chemical purification.
6.  **Operation:** Pour water slowly. The first few liters should be discarded until the water runs clear.

## Materials needed

- **Filtering Media:** **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel)**, **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**.
- **Housing:** **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)** (plastic, ceramic, wood).
- **Separators:** **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or fine mesh.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ceramic Filter:** Porous clay pot impregnated with silver (antibacterial). Very effective against bacteria.
- **Cloth Filter:** Folded sari cloth (used in Bangladesh) filters out copepods that carry cholera.
- **Solar Disinfection (SODIS):** Using clear bottles and sunlight (UV) after filtration to kill remaining viruses.

## Limits and risks

- **Viruses:** Basic sand filters may not remove all viruses (too small). Boiling or chemical disinfection is still recommended.
- **Maintenance:** Filters clog over time and need cleaning (backwashing) or replacing.
- **Breakthrough:** If flow is too fast, contaminants can be pushed through.
- **Chemicals:** Standard filters don't remove dissolved heavy metals or salt.
