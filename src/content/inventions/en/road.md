# Brief description

A prepared hard surface dedicated to transportation, improving the speed and safety of travel for people and vehicles.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Facilitate the movement of wheeled vehicles, animals, and pedestrians.
- **Secondary uses:** Drainage management, defining borders, trade routes.
- **Scale:** From local paths to intercontinental highway networks.

## Operating principle

- **Load Distribution:** Spreads the weight of heavy loads (carts, trucks) over a wider area of the soil to prevent sinking (rutting).
- **Surface Quality:** Provides a smooth, hard surface that reduces friction/resistance for wheels and prevents mud formation.

## How to create it

### Roman Style (Stone/Concrete)
1.  **Survey & Dig:** Dig a trench to solid ground (fossa).
2.  **Foundation:** Layer of large stones compacted into the earth (statumen).
3.  **Middle Layers:** Gravel and sand, sometimes with lime mortar (rudus/nucleus).
4.  **Surface:** Large, fitted flat stones (summum dorsum) or concrete.
5.  **Camber:** The center is higher than the sides to drain water.

### Modern Style (Asphalt/Macadam)
1.  **Sub-base:** Compacted soil and heavy gravel.
2.  **Base:** Smaller crushed stone.
3.  **Binder Course:** Coarse aggregate with bitumen.
4.  **Surface Course:** Fine aggregate with bitumen (Asphalt).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Stone, Gravel, Sand.
- **Binders:** Lime (for concrete), Bitumen (for asphalt).
- **Tools:** Picks, shovels, rammers/tampers, levels.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dirt Track:** Cleared but unpaved (muddy when wet).
- **Corduroy Road:** Logs placed perpendicular to the path (for swamps).
- **Macadam:** Layers of crushed stone of specific sizes, compacted (water-bound).
- **Tarmac/Asphalt:** Sealed with bitumen/tar to prevent dust and water damage.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance:** Requires constant repair (potholes, cracks).
- **Water:** Water is the enemy; without drainage, the base washes away.
- **Cost:** High labor and material cost to build and maintain.
