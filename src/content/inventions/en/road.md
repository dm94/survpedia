# Brief description

A prepared hard surface dedicated to transportation, improving the speed and safety of travel for people and vehicles.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Facilitate the movement of [wheeled](/en/inventions/wheel) vehicles, animals, and pedestrians.
- **Secondary uses:** [Drainage](/en/inventions/drainage) management, defining borders, trade routes.
- **Scale:** From local paths to intercontinental highway networks.

## Operating principle

- **Load Distribution:** Spreads the weight of heavy loads ([carts](/en/inventions/cart), trucks) over a wider area of the soil to prevent sinking (rutting).
- **Surface Quality:** Provides a smooth, hard surface that reduces friction/resistance for [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel) and prevents mud formation.

## How to create it

### Roman Style (Stone/Concrete)

1.  **Survey & Dig:** Dig a trench to solid ground (fossa).
2.  **[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation):** Layer of large [stones](/en/materials/stone) compacted into the earth (statumen).
3.  **Middle Layers:** [Gravel](/en/materials/gravel) and [sand](/en/materials/sand), sometimes with [lime](/en/materials/lime) [mortar](/en/materials/mortar) (rudus/nucleus).
4.  **Surface:** Large, fitted flat [stones](/en/materials/stone) (summum dorsum) or [concrete](/en/materials/concrete).
5.  **Camber:** The center is higher than the sides to drain water.

### Modern Style (Asphalt/Macadam)

1.  **Sub-base:** Compacted soil and heavy [gravel](/en/materials/gravel).
2.  **Base:** Smaller crushed [stone](/en/materials/stone).
3.  **Binder Course:** Coarse aggregate with [bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen).
4.  **Surface Course:** Fine aggregate with [bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen) ([Asphalt Concrete](/en/materials/asphalt-concrete)).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** [Stone](/en/materials/stone), [Gravel](/en/materials/gravel), [Sand](/en/materials/sand).
- **Binders:** [Lime](/en/materials/lime) (for [concrete](/en/materials/concrete)), [Bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen) (for [asphalt concrete](/en/materials/asphalt-concrete)).
- **Tools:** [Pickaxes](/en/inventions/pickaxe), [shovels](/en/inventions/shovel), [rammers](/en/inventions/rammer), [levels](/en/inventions/level).

## Variants and improvements

- **Dirt Track:** Cleared but unpaved (muddy when wet).
- **[Corduroy Road](/en/inventions/corduroy-road):** Logs placed perpendicular to the path (for swamps).
- **[Macadam](/en/inventions/macadam):** Layers of crushed stone of specific sizes, compacted (water-bound).
- **Tarmac/Asphalt:** Sealed with [bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen)/[tar](/en/materials/tar) to prevent dust and water damage.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance:** Requires constant repair (potholes, cracks).
- **Water:** Water is the enemy; without drainage, the base washes away.
- **Cost:** High labor and material cost to build and maintain.
