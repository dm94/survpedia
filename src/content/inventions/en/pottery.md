# Brief description

Pottery is the art and technology of making objects from shaped clay that is then hardened by the application of heat at high temperatures.

## Use / Function

- **Storage:** Vessels for grain, water, or oil.
- **Cooking:** Fire-resistant pots and plates.
- **Lighting:** Oil lamps.
- **Construction:** Bricks, tiles, and floor tiles.
- **Sanitation:** Pipes and conduits.

## Operating principle

Clay contains chemically bound water. When heated above 600°C, it loses this water and undergoes an irreversible transformation called sintering, where particles fuse partially creating a solid, rigid, and durable structure.

## How to create it

1. **Preparation:** Mix clay with water until a malleable mass is obtained.
2. **Shaping:** Shape by hand, by coils, or using a [potter's wheel](/en/inventions/potters-wheel).
3. **Drying:** Let water evaporate at room temperature to avoid cracks.
4. **Firing:** Heat in a [kiln](/en/inventions/kiln) or pit at high temperatures (800°C - 1200°C).

## Materials needed

- **[Clay](/en/materials/clay):** Clayey soil rich in silicates.
- **[Water](/en/materials/water):** For plasticity.
- **Temper:** **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** or chopped **[straw](/en/materials/straw)** to reduce shrinkage during drying.
- **Fuel:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for the kiln.

## Variants and improvements

- **Terracotta:** Porous pottery fired at low temperature.
- **Stoneware:** Denser and stronger, fired at higher temperature.
- **Porcelain:** White and translucent, high quality.
- **Glazing:** Application of a glassy layer to make it completely waterproof.

## Limits and risks

- **Brittleness:** Breaks easily on impact or falls.
- **Thermal shock:** Sudden temperature changes can crack it.
- **Contamination:** Some old glazes contained lead.
