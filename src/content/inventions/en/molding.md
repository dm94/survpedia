Molding is a manufacturing process used to shape liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix. This may have been done using patterns of the final object.

# Brief description

A technique to create objects of a specific shape by filling a hollow form (mold) with a material that starts soft or liquid and then hardens. It is the fundamental process for creating bricks, concrete blocks, pottery, and metal tools.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Mass production of identical building units (bricks, blocks).
- **Secondary uses:** Creating complex shapes that would be difficult or impossible to carve from solid material.
- **Scale:** From single-item crafting (pottery) to massive industrial production (brick factories).

## Operating principle

The process relies on the state change of a material:

1.  **Fluidity:** The material (clay, concrete, molten metal) must be fluid or plastic enough to fill the mold's details.
2.  **Containment:** The mold holds the material in shape against gravity and hydrostatic pressure.
3.  **Solidification:** The material hardens through drying (clay), chemical reaction (concrete), or cooling (metal).
4.  **Release:** The mold is removed, leaving the solid object.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

A simple wooden box without a top or bottom, placed on a flat surface.

1.  **Frame:** Nail four wooden boards together to form a rectangle (e.g., for a brick).
2.  **Lubrication:** Wet the mold and coat it with sand (release agent) to prevent sticking.
3.  **Filling:** Throw a clot of clay or pour concrete into the mold.
4.  **Leveling:** Scrape off excess material from the top.
5.  **Demolding:** Lift the frame straight up, leaving the shaped material on the ground to dry/cure.

### Technical level required

**Basic.** Anyone can make a simple mold for mud bricks or concrete.

## Materials needed

- **Essentials:**
  - **Mold Material:** Wood (planks), Metal (sheets), or Plaster. Must be rigid.
  - **Release Agent:** Sand, Oil, Water, or Ash to prevent sticking.
- **Tools:**
  - Saw and Hammer (for wooden molds).
  - Trowel or straight edge (for leveling).

### Possible substitutes

- **Earth:** A hole dug in the ground (sand casting) is the simplest mold.
- **Wax:** For "Lost Wax" casting (advanced), where a wax model is encased in clay, then melted out.
- **Flexible materials:** Latex or silicone (modern) for complex undercuts.

## Variants and improvements

- **Slop Molding:** Using very wet clay, easy to fill but shrinks more.
- **Sand Molding:** Using stiff clay coated in sand, produces sharper edges (standard brickmaking).
- **Piece Molds:** Molds made of multiple sections to allow removal of objects with complex shapes (undercuts).
- **Gang Molds:** Multiple molds joined together to make many items at once.

## Limits and risks

- **Draft Angle:** Vertical sides must be slightly tapered or perfectly straight; otherwise, the object will get stuck in the mold.
- **Undercuts:** You cannot mold a shape that locks itself into a rigid mold (unless the mold can be taken apart).
- **Trapped Air:** If air bubbles are trapped against the mold surface, the final object will have voids/holes.
- **Sticking:** If the release agent fails, the object will be destroyed when trying to remove the mold.
