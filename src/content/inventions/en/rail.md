# Brief description

A **Rail** is a bar of rolled steel forming a track for wheeled vehicles. Rails are laid on sleepers (ties) and ballast to form a permanent way for trains, trams, and mine carts.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** The primary component of railway tracks, allowing for the efficient movement of heavy loads over long distances with low friction.
- **Guidance:** Flanges on the wheels run against the rails, steering the vehicle without the need for a driver to steer.
- **Load Distribution:** Spreads the immense weight of the train over a larger area of the ground (via sleepers and ballast).

## Operating principle

The interaction between the steel wheel and the steel rail produces very low **rolling friction**, making rail transport extremely energy-efficient. The rail acts as a smooth, hard surface that resists deformation under heavy loads.

## How to create it

1.  **Material Production:** Produce high-quality **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** (originally **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**) with specific properties for hardness and toughness.
2.  **Rolling:** Heat the steel billet to white-hot temperatures and pass it through a **[Rolling Mill](/en/inventions/rolling-mill)** with specially shaped rolls to form the "I" beam profile (T-rail).
3.  **Cooling and Straightening:** Controlled cooling to prevent warping, followed by straightening in a roller straightener.
4.  **Laying:** Fix the rails to **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** sleepers (ties) using spikes or clips, maintaining a precise gauge (distance between rails).

## Materials needed

- **Rail:** High-carbon Steel.
- **Sleepers:** Treated Hardwood or Prestressed Concrete.
- **Ballast:** Crushed **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** (Gravel) to drain water and lock the sleepers in place.
- **Fasteners:** Steel spikes, bolts, and clips.

## Variants and improvements

- **Strap Rail:** An early form consisting of a thin iron strap nailed to a wooden rail (dangerous, as straps could peel up).
- **Plateway:** L-shaped rails where the flange is on the rail, not the wheel (obsolete).
- **T-Rail (Vignoles):** The standard modern rail profile with a flat bottom.
- **Bullhead Rail:** A reversible rail profile (common in the UK historically).

## Limits and risks

- **Thermal Expansion:** Rails expand in heat and contract in cold. Gaps (expansion joints) or stressing (in continuously welded rail) are needed to prevent buckling (sun kinks).
- **Wear:** Curves and heavy braking cause wear on the rail head.
- **Fracture:** Internal defects in the steel can lead to catastrophic rail breaks.
