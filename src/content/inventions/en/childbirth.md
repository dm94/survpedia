# Brief description

Childbirth is the practical set of preparations and techniques that support a safe delivery for the mother and newborn, emphasizing cleanliness, steady positioning, and careful monitoring.

## Use / Function

- **Safe delivery**: Support the baby’s passage with minimal trauma.
- **Hygiene**: Reduce infection risk during labor and after birth.
- **Bleeding control**: Limit blood loss with timely checks and clean materials.
- **Newborn care**: Keep the baby warm, breathing, and clean.
- **Scale**: Individual to small community settings.

## Operating principle

- **Clean field**: Clean hands, surfaces, and cloths limit bacterial load.
- **Positioning and support**: Upright or side positions help gravity and reduce strain.
- **Controlled handling**: Gentle guidance minimizes tearing and stress.
- **Thermal protection**: Warmth prevents newborn heat loss.
- **Observation**: Regular checks catch complications early.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare a clean space**: Wash hands and surfaces with **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)** and **[Water](/en/materials/water)**; lay clean **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**.
2. **Arrange materials**: Clean **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)**, clean cutting tool, and warm wraps.
3. **Support labor**: Encourage steady breathing, hydration, and positions that reduce strain; follow **[Labor (Childbirth)](/en/knowledge/childbirth-labor)** for pacing and monitoring.
4. **Guide delivery**: Use gentle support, avoiding force; keep the area clean.
5. **Care for the cord**: Tie with clean thread and cut with a clean tool; keep the stump dry.
6. **Post-birth check**: Ensure placenta delivery, monitor bleeding, and keep both warm and clean.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)**.
- **Hygiene and care**: **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** for tool cleaning when available.
- **Comfort and support**: **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for ties, **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** or **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** for protective salves.
- **Tools**: Clean cutting tool, clean basin, warm wraps, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** stool or bench.
- **Possible substitutes**: Boiled clean cloths, plant fiber cord, and clean ash-water for basic cleaning when soap is unavailable.

## Variants and improvements

- **Birth stool**: Improves posture and gravity assistance.
- **Hammock support**: Reduces strain and allows assisted positioning.
- **Sterile kit**: Pre-wrapped clean cloths, thread, and tools for safer procedures.
- **Postpartum routine**: Scheduled checks for bleeding, temperature, and hydration.

## Limits and risks

- **Hemorrhage**: Rapid blood loss requires immediate action.
- **Obstructed labor**: Mispositioned baby can threaten both lives.
- **Infection**: Poor hygiene can cause severe complications.
- **Tearing**: Excess force or poor positioning increases injury.
- **Newborn distress**: Cold stress or breathing problems require prompt care.
