# Brief description

A designated area on a road for pedestrians to cross safely, often marked with distinct patterns or raised surfaces to alert drivers.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Provide a safe crossing point for pedestrians across roads with vehicle traffic.
- **Secondary uses:** Traffic calming (when raised), organizing urban flow.
- **Scale:** Local, urban streets, intersections.

## Operating principle

- **Visual Contrast:** High-contrast markings (usually white stripes on dark asphalt) make the crossing visible to drivers from a distance.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Raised surfaces or different textures (like cobblestones) alert drivers through vibration and pedestrians through feel.
- **Right of Way:** Establishes a legal or social convention where vehicles must yield to pedestrians.

## How to create it

### Basic Painted Crosswalk (Zebra)

1.  **Selection:** Choose a location with good visibility for both pedestrians and drivers.
2.  **Cleaning:** Clean the road surface to ensure paint adhesion.
3.  **Marking:** Paint parallel white stripes (about 40-60 cm wide) across the road width.
4.  **Signage:** Add vertical signs to warn approaching drivers.

### Raised Crosswalk (Speed Table)

1.  **Forming:** Build a flat-topped hump across the road using [asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt) or [concrete](/en/materials/concrete).
2.  **Ramping:** Create gentle ramps on both sides for vehicles to ascend and descend.
3.  **Surfacing:** Mark the top surface with [paint](/en/materials/paint) or different colored [stones](/en/materials/stone).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** [Paint](/en/materials/paint) (durable road marking paint), [Stone](/en/materials/stone) (for cobblestone crossings).
- **Construction:** [Asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt) or [Concrete](/en/materials/concrete) (for raised versions).
- **Tools:** Brushes, stencils, road rollers (for asphalt).

## Variants and improvements

- **Zebra Crossing:** The classic black and white striped pattern.
- **Pelican/Puffin Crossing:** Incorporates traffic lights for controlled crossing (requires electricity).
- **Raised Crosswalk:** Acts as a speed bump to physically slow down traffic.
- **Textured Crossing:** Uses different materials like bricks or cobblestones for aesthetic and tactile distinction.

## Limits and risks

- **Visibility:** Markings can fade or become obscured by snow/dirt.
- **Driver Compliance:** Relies on drivers obeying the rules; does not physically stop a car (unless combined with barriers/lights).
- **False Security:** Pedestrians may assume safety without checking for oncoming traffic.
