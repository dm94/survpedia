# Brief description

Simple fortifications are enhanced defensive structures designed to protect a perimeter, settlement, or camp from external threats, such as predators or hostile raids. They represent a step up from basic shelter, focusing on security rather than just weather protection.

## Use / Function

- **Perimeter Defense:** Create a physical barrier to stop or slow down intruders.
- **Territory Control:** Clearly define the boundaries of a safe zone.
- **Observation:** Provide elevated positions to spot threats from a distance.
- **Scale:** Settlement / Camp.

## Operating principle

They rely on **physical obstruction** and **tactical advantage**.
- **Obstruction:** Walls, palisades, and ditches force attackers to stop or funnel into specific areas (choke points).
- **Elevation:** Watchtowers or raised platforms allow defenders to see further and attack from above with gravity on their side.

## How to create it

1.  **Site Selection:** Choose high ground or an area with natural barriers (cliff, river).
2.  **Perimeter Clearing:** Clear brush and trees around the site to remove cover for attackers.
3.  **Earthworks:** Dig a trench or dry moat around the perimeter. Use the excavated earth to build a berm or raised bank behind the trench.
4.  **Palisade:** Drive sharpened logs into the top of the berm or directly into the ground, lashing them together for stability.
5.  **Gates:** Construct a reinforced gate that can be barred from the inside.
6.  **Technical level:** Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
    - **Logs/Timber:** For palisades, gates, and towers.
    - **Earth/Stone:** For berms, walls, and trench reinforcement.
- **Tools:**
    - **Shovel:** For digging trenches and moving earth.
    - **Axe/Saw:** For felling trees and sharpening logs.
    - **Hammer/Mallet:** For driving posts.
- **Substitutes:**
    - **Thorny Bushes:** Can be piled up to create a "boma" or defensive hedge.
    - **Stone Walls:** Dry-stacked stones if wood is scarce.

## Variants and improvements

- **Wooden Palisade:** A continuous wall of vertical logs.
- **Earthwork/Rampart:** A raised bank of earth, often topped with a palisade.
- **Ditch/Moat:** A trench aimed at breaking the charge of an attacker.
- **Watchtower:** A simple wooden tower for lookout purposes.

## Limits and risks

- **Fire:** Wooden fortifications are vulnerable to fire.
- **Maintenance:** Wood rots and earth erodes; constant repair is needed.
- **Siege:** A static defense can become a trap if the defenders are surrounded and cut off from food/water.
- **Blind Spots:** Poorly designed walls can create areas where attackers can hide close to the perimeter.
