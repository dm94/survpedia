# Brief description

Hollow cylinders used to convey substances which can flow, such as liquids, gases, slurries, or powders.

## Use / Function

- **Transport:** Moving water, sewage, or gas from one point to another.
- **Irrigation:** Distributing water to crops efficiently.
- **Plumbing:** Supplying potable water and removing waste in buildings.
- **Protection:** Encasing wires or cables (modern).

## Operating principle

Pipes contain fluids and direct their flow. The movement is driven by **pressure difference**, created either by gravity (slope) or pumps. The cylindrical shape provides high structural strength against internal and external pressure.

## How to create it

1.  **Clay:** Roll clay into cylinders or use a mold. Fire in a kiln to harden. Can be glazed to make them watertight.
2.  **Bamboo:** Select straight bamboo stalks. Knock out the internal nodes using a long rod.
3.  **Wood:** Split a log, hollow out both halves, and rejoin them with resin and binding; or drill through the center with a long auger.
4.  **Lead:** Cast flat sheets of lead, roll them around a form, and solder the seam.

## Materials needed

- **Clay:** Abundant and easy to work with.
- **Bamboo:** Natural ready-made pipe.
- **Lead:** Malleable metal (historical, but toxic).
- **Wood:** Requires tools to hollow.
- **Copper/Bronze:** Durable but requires metallurgy.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ceramic/Terracotta:** Common in ancient times for water and sewage.
- **Lead (Plumbing):** Used by Romans, but causes lead poisoning.
- **Cast Iron/Steel:** Stronger, for high pressure.
- **PVC/Plastic:** Modern standard, lightweight and corrosion-resistant.

## Limits and risks

- **Leaks:** Joints are the weakest points.
- **Bursting:** Freezing water can expand and burst pipes.
- **Corrosion:** Metal pipes degrade over time.
- **Toxicity:** Lead pipes are hazardous to health.
