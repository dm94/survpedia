# Brief description

Fireworks are pyrotechnic devices that create light, color, and sound through controlled combustion. They are used for celebration, signaling, and display.

## Use / Function

- **Celebration and ceremony:** Visual and auditory displays for festivals and holidays.
- **Signaling:** Historical use for military and maritime signals.
- **Public events:** Coordinated shows for large gatherings.
- **Scale:** Community to mass events.

## Operating principle

Fireworks rely on rapid combustion of a fuel and oxidizer. A lift charge propels the shell upward, a time fuse delays ignition, and a burst charge ignites stars. The stars contain metal salts that emit color when burning, while binders and charcoal influence burn rate and sparkle.

## How to create it

- **Design:** Choose a casing, fuse timing, and the desired effect (burst, fountain, crackle).
- **Composition:** Prepare a stable fuel-oxidizer mix and stars that burn with specific colors.
- **Assembly:** Pack the lift charge, shell, and stars so the fuse triggers the burst at altitude.
- **Technical level:** Advanced. Requires precise control of materials and strict safety standards.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Paper casing, gunpowder, timed fuse, and star compositions (fuel, oxidizer, metal salts).
- **Tools:** Molds, rammers, drying space, and protective equipment.
- **Possible substitutes:** For low-intensity signals, use simpler flares with fewer color additives.

## Variants and improvements

- **Firecrackers:** Loud report with minimal light.
- **Aerial shells:** High-altitude bursts with multi-break patterns.
- **Fountains:** Ground-based sprays of sparks.
- **Rockets:** Self-propelled ascent with a burst at peak.
- **Computer-synced shows:** Precise timing with digital ignition.

## Limits and risks

- **Fire hazard:** Hot embers and falling debris can ignite structures or vegetation.
- **Injury risk:** Misfires and early bursts can cause severe burns or trauma.
- **Noise impact:** Loud reports can harm hearing or disturb wildlife.
- **Regulation:** Often restricted by local laws and safety codes.
