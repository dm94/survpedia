## History

Fireworks originated in medieval China during the Tang Dynasty (7th century). Originally used to ward off evil spirits with their loud noise. By the Song Dynasty, pyrotechnics had become an art form. The Italians later became famous for adding colors to fireworks during the Renaissance by introducing metal salts.

## How it Works

A firework typically consists of a shell (paper), a lift charge (gunpowder to shoot it up), and a burst charge (gunpowder to explode it) containing "stars" (pellets of chemical mixtures that burn with color/sparkles).

## Impact

Fireworks have become a global symbol of celebration, used in New Year's Eve, national holidays, and festivals worldwide. They also advanced the understanding of chemistry and ballistics.
