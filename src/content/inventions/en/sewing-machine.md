# Brief description

A mechanical device used to stitch fabric and other materials together with thread. It automates the stitching process, significantly increasing speed and uniformity compared to hand sewing.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Rapid production of clothing, upholstery, and sails.
- **Secondary uses**: Embroidery, quilting, and leatherwork.
- **Scale**: Domestic to industrial mass production.

## Operating Principle

Most sewing machines use a **lockstitch** mechanism, which involves two threads:

1.  **Upper Thread**: Carried by the needle through the fabric.
2.  **Lower Thread (Bobbin)**: Housed in a shuttle or hook assembly below the fabric.

**Process**:

1.  The needle pushes the upper thread through the fabric to form a loop.
2.  A shuttle hook catches this loop and wraps it around the lower thread (bobbin thread).
3.  The needle pulls up, tightening the loop to form a lockstitch inside the layers of fabric.

## How to create it

Creating a functional sewing machine requires precision engineering and metallurgy.

### Key Components

1.  **Needle Bar**: Moves the needle up and down vertically.
2.  **Shuttle/Hook Assembly**: Rotates or oscillates to catch the thread loop.
3.  **Feed Dogs**: Metal teeth that move the fabric forward after each stitch.
4.  **Hand Wheel / Treadle**: Provides mechanical power to drive the gears and shafts.

### Technical Level

Advanced. Requires precise machining of gears, shafts, and timing mechanisms.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**: For gears, shafts, needle bar, and frame.
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: For the table or base.
  - **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)**: Specialized machine needle with the eye near the point.
  - **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)**: Strong thread for stitching.
- **Tools**:
  - **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)**: For turning shafts and precision parts.
  - **[Milling Machine](/en/inventions/milling-machine)**: For cutting gears and slots.
  - **[Drill Press](/en/inventions/drill-press)**: For precise holes.

## Variants and improvements

- **Chain Stitch Machine**: Uses a single thread (easier to build but stitches can unravel).
- **Treadle Machine**: Foot-powered, leaving hands free to guide fabric.
- **Electric Machine**: Motor-driven for high speed and consistent power.
- **Zigzag Machine**: Needle moves side-to-side for reinforced stitching or buttonholes.

## Relationship with Loom

The **[Loom](/en/inventions/loom)** produces the **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** that the sewing machine uses.

- **Loom**: Weaves **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)** into cloth.
- **Sewing Machine**: Stitches cloth into garments.

Without the loom (or similar fabric-making process like knitting), the sewing machine would have no material to work on.

## Limits and risks

- **Complexity**: High precision required; slight misalignment causes skipped stitches or broken needles.
- **Maintenance**: Requires regular oiling and cleaning of lint.
- **Safety**: Moving parts (needle, gears) can cause injury; fingers must be kept clear of the needle.
