# Brief description

A structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath. It provides passage over the obstacle.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation**: Allows people, animals, and vehicles to cross rivers, valleys, or other roads.
- **Trade**: Facilitates the movement of goods between separated regions.
- **Communication**: Connects communities that would otherwise be isolated.
- **Scale**: From small footbridges to massive multi-kilometer industrial viaducts.

## Operating principle

Bridges work by balancing forces:

- **Compression**: Pushing forces (common in arch and stone bridges).
- **Tension**: Pulling forces (common in suspension and rope bridges).
- **Bending**: The tendency of a beam to sag when loaded (common in simple beam bridges).
- **Shear**: Sliding forces.

The structure transfers the load (Dead Load: weight of bridge + Live Load: traffic) to the ground through piers, abutments, or towers.

## How to create it

1.  **Survey**: Choose stable ground on both sides of the obstacle.
2.  **Foundation**: Dig down to bedrock or stable soil. For water crossings, cofferdams or piles may be needed.
3.  **Substructure**: Build the piers or abutments that will support the bridge.
4.  **Superstructure**: Construct the span (beams, arches, or cables) connecting the supports.
5.  **Deck**: Lay the flooring surface for traffic.

### Basic Types creation:

- **Beam Bridge**: Place a rigid beam (log, stone slab) across two supports. Limited span.
- **Arch Bridge**: Build a temporary wooden support (centering). Lay stones/bricks from both sides until they meet at the top (keystone). Remove centering.
- **Suspension Bridge**: Anchor strong ropes/cables on both banks. Hang the deck from these main cables.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **Wood**: For short spans, temporary bridges, or truss elements.
  - **Stone/Brick**: For durable arch bridges (requires mortar).
  - **Rope/Cables**: For suspension bridges.
  - **Concrete/Steel**: For modern, long-span bridges.
- **Tools**: Saws, chisels, hammers, cranes (pulleys), levels.

## Variants and improvements

- **Log Bridge**: The simplest form.
- **Clapper Bridge**: Stone slabs on stone piers (ancient).
- **Arch Bridge**: Roman invention, extremely durable.
- **Truss Bridge**: Uses triangles (wood or metal) to distribute weight efficiently.
- **Suspension Bridge**: Allows for the longest spans (e.g., Golden Gate).
- **[Cable-Stayed Bridge](/en/inventions/cable-stayed-bridge)**: A modern variant with cables connected directly to towers, ideal for medium to long spans.
- **Cantilever Bridge**: Built using structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end.
- **Movable Bridge**: Drawbridges to allow boat traffic.

## Limits and risks

- **Resonance**: Rhythmic marching or strong winds can cause the bridge to vibrate and collapse (e.g., Tacoma Narrows).
- **Scour**: Water moving fast around piers can wash away the foundation.
- **Overload**: Exceeding the weight limit causes structural failure.
- **Corrosion/Rot**: Wood rots, iron rusts. Maintenance is crucial.
