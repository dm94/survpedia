# Brief description

An axle is a central shaft for a rotating [wheel](/en/inventions/wheel) or gear. On wheeled vehicles, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle.

## Use / Function

- **Support:** It bears the weight of the vehicle and its load.
- **Rotation:** It allows the wheels to rotate, enabling movement.
- **Torque Transmission:** In driven systems, it transmits power from the engine/source to the wheels.

## Operating principle

The axle acts as a fulcrum or a hinge point.

- **Dead Axle:** The axle is stationary (fixed to the frame), and the wheels rotate around it using bearings or grease to reduce friction.
- **Live Axle:** The axle rotates, and the wheels are fixed to it. The axle itself is supported by bearings on the vehicle frame.

## How to create it

### Basic Wooden Axle

1.  **Selection:** Choose a straight, strong branch or trunk of hardwood (e.g., oak, hickory).
2.  **Shaping:** Carve it into a perfect cylinder. The ends must be particularly smooth and uniform to fit the wheel hubs.
3.  **Smoothing:** Sand or polish the surface to minimize friction.
4.  **Fitting:** Ensure it fits tightly into the vehicle frame (for dead axles) or wheel hubs (for live axles).

### Metal Axle

1.  **Forging/Casting:** Create a metal rod of uniform thickness.
2.  **Machining:** Use a lathe to ensure perfect cylindrical shape and smooth surface.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Hardwood or Metal (Iron/Steel).
- **Tools:** Knife/Chisel (for wood), Hammer/Anvil (for metal), Measuring tools.
- **Lubricant:** Animal fat or oil is crucial for the bearing surfaces.

## Variants and improvements

- **Stub Axle:** A short axle that supports only one wheel (used in modern car steering).
- **Differential:** A complex gear arrangement allowing wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds (for turning).

## Limits and risks

- **Breaking:** If the axle is too thin or the wood has knots, it can snap under heavy load.
- **Wear:** Without lubrication, friction will quickly wear down the axle or the wheel hub, causing wobbling and eventual failure.
- **Friction Heat:** Excessive speed without lubrication can generate enough heat to char wood or damage metal.
