# Brief description

A fire piston is a small device that uses rapid air compression to ignite tinder in a sealed cylinder.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Create an ember by compressing air.
- **Secondary uses:** Reliable ignition in humid climates with good tinder.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

When air is compressed very quickly, its temperature rises sharply. The hot air ignites a tiny piece of tinder placed at the piston tip, creating an ember.

## How to create it

1. **Make the cylinder:** A smooth, straight tube of hardwood, bamboo, or bone.
2. **Make the piston:** A tight-fitting rod with a seal (leather or plant fiber).
3. **Add tinder:** Place a small tinder pellet at the piston tip.
4. **Compress:** Slam the piston quickly into the cylinder.
5. **Recover ember:** Remove and transfer the ember to a tinder bundle.
6. **Technical level:** Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Cylinder, piston, seal, tinder pellet.
- **Tools:** Knife, scraper, abrasive for smoothing.
- **Substitutes:** Resin or wax to improve the seal.

## Variants and improvements

- **Glass or metal cylinder:** Durable and smoother, requires higher technology.
- **Lubricated seal:** Reduces friction and improves air tightness.
- **Tinder cup:** Small recess to hold tinder securely.

## Limits and risks

- **Precision required:** Poor fit prevents ignition.
- **Tinder sensitive:** Needs very dry, compact tinder.
- **Pinched fingers:** Fast compression can injure hands.
