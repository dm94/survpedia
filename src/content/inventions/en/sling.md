# Brief description

A sling is a projectile weapon typically used to throw a blunt projectile such as a stone, clay, or lead "sling-bullet". It is known for its simplicity, range, and lethal power (famously used by David against Goliath).

## Use / Function

- **Combat**: Effective long-range weapon capable of causing severe blunt trauma.
- **Hunting**: Used to hunt small game or protect herds from predators.

## Operating principle

The sling works by extending the length of the human arm, allowing the stone to be accelerated to a much higher velocity than could be achieved by throwing by hand alone. The slinger spins the sling to build up speed and releases one cord at the precise moment to launch the projectile tangentially.

## How to create it

1.  **Cords**: Braid two lengths of strong cord from plant fibers (hemp, flax) or cut leather strips. One cord should have a loop for a finger, the other a knot or tab for gripping.
2.  **Pouch**: Create a pouch in the center to hold the stone. This can be a wider piece of leather or a split/woven section of the cords.
3.  **Assembly**: Sew or tie the cords securely to the pouch. Total length is usually from chest to ground or arm's length.

## Materials needed

- **Cordage**: Plant fibers, leather strips, or wool.
- **Pouch Material**: Leather, heavy fabric, or woven fibers.
- **Ammunition**: Smooth, round stones (river rocks) or molded clay/lead bullets.

## Variants and improvements

- **Staff Sling**: A sling attached to the end of a staff for even greater range and leverage.
- **Lead Bullets**: Casting lead projectiles significantly improves range and impact over stones due to higher density.

## Limits and risks

- **Skill**: Requires significant practice to achieve accuracy and proper timing.
- **Safety**: Risk of hitting oneself or allies if released poorly.
- **Space**: Requires room to swing the sling.
