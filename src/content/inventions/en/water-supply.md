# Brief description

A comprehensive system designed to collect, treat, store, and distribute water to homes, industries, and public facilities. It is the backbone of public health and urban civilization.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Providing safe drinking water (potable water) to a population.
- **Secondary uses:** Sanitation, irrigation, industrial processes, and fire suppression.
- **Scale:** Community to metropolitan.

## Operating principle

1.  **Collection:** Water is gathered from a source (river, lake, reservoir, or groundwater).
2.  **Transmission:** Water is moved via **[aqueducts](/en/inventions/aqueduct)** or large pipes to a treatment plant.
3.  **Treatment:** Impurities and pathogens are removed (filtration, sedimentation, disinfection).
4.  **Storage:** Treated water is stored in reservoirs or water towers to ensure constant pressure and supply during peak demand.
5.  **Distribution:** A network of smaller **[pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)** delivers water to individual users.

## How to create it

1.  **Source Identification:** Find a reliable water source (surface or underground) with sufficient quantity.
2.  **Intake Structure:** Build a structure to draw water while minimizing sediment and debris (screens, cribs).
3.  **Transport:** Construct a gravity-fed or pumped line to the settlement.
4.  **Storage:** Build a water tower or elevated cistern. The height provides hydrostatic pressure for the distribution network.
5.  **Distribution Network:** Lay a grid of pipes. Use a "loop" layout rather than a "branch" layout to prevent stagnation and ensure supply if one section breaks.

## Materials needed

- **Pipes:** **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** (PVC, HDPE), **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)** (Cast iron, copper), or **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**.
- **Storage:** **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**, or **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** for tanks.
- **Sealing:** **[Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)** gaskets or **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** (historical, toxic) / tow and grease.
- **Machinery:** **[Pumps](/en/inventions/pump)** and valves.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gravity System:** Relies entirely on elevation differences. No energy cost, highly reliable.
- **Pumped System:** Uses mechanical energy to pressurize water. Allows supply in flat terrain but requires fuel/electricity.
- **Dual Supply:** Separate systems for potable water and "grey water" (for flushing/irrigation) to conserve resources.

## Limits and risks

- **Contamination:** A breach in the pipes can introduce pathogens. Negative pressure (vacuum) can suck in groundwater.
- **Leakage:** Significant water is often lost to leaks in old systems.
- **Freezing:** Pipes must be buried below the frost line to prevent bursting.
- **Drought:** Reliability depends entirely on the source's capacity.
