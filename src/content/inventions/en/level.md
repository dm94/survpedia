# Brief description

A level is an instrument used to establish or verify a horizontal plane. It is essential in construction, carpentry, and masonry to ensure that surfaces are flat and structures are aligned with gravity.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Determining if a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb).
- **Secondary uses:** Transferring elevation points across a distance (water level).
- **Scale:** Domestic to Industrial.

## Operating principle

- **Water Level:** Based on the principle that water in a connected system seeks its own level due to gravity. If a tube is filled with water, the surface at both ends will be at the same elevation, regardless of the tube's shape.
- **Spirit Level:** Uses a bubble in a liquid-filled vial. The vial is slightly curved so that the bubble naturally seeks the highest point. When the bubble is centered between markings, the surface is level.

## How to create it

### Water Level (Simplest)

1.  **Materials:** A long, clear flexible tube ([hose](./hose)) and water.
2.  **Assembly:** Fill the hose with water, ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.
3.  **Use:** Hold the ends up. The water level at one end matches the elevation of the water level at the other end.

### Spirit Level

1.  **Materials:** A small glass or plastic vial, alcohol (to prevent freezing and allow free movement), and a straight frame.
2.  **Assembly:** Fill the vial leaving a small bubble. Seal it. Mount it precisely in a straight block of wood or metal.
3.  **Calibration:** Place on a surface, mark the bubble's position. Rotate 180 degrees. Adjust until the bubble is in the same position in both orientations.

- **Technical level:** Basic (Water Level) to Intermediate (Spirit Level).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Clear tubing or a [glass](/en/materials/glass) vial, liquid ([water](/en/materials/water) or [alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)).
- **Tools:** Saws and sandpaper for the frame.
- **Substitutes:** A [plumb bob](./plumb-bob) can be used to find vertical, and a square can then determine horizontal.

## Variants and improvements

- **A-Frame Level:** A large "A" shape with a plumb bob hanging from the apex. When the plumb line aligns with a mark on the crossbar, the feet are level.
- **Laser Level:** Uses a laser beam to project a level line.
- **Bullseye Level:** A circular level for leveling planes in all directions at once.

## Limits and risks

- **Accuracy:** Depends on the straightness of the frame and the precision of the vial mounting.
- **Parallax:** Reading the bubble from an angle can cause errors.
- **Temperature:** Extreme heat or cold can affect the bubble size or liquid viscosity.
