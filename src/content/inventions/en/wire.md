# Brief description

Wire is a single, usually cylindrical, flexible strand or rod of metal. It is formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate.

## Use / Function

-   **Conduction:** Essential for electricity transmission (especially copper).
-   **Construction:** Binding, fencing, and structural support.
-   **Manufacturing:** Needles, springs, and jewelry.
-   **Mechanisms:** Cables for suspension bridges or pulleys.

## Operating principle

It relies on the property of **ductility**: the ability of a material to deform under tensile stress (being pulled) without fracturing. By forcing the metal through a smaller hole, the crystal structure elongates, making the wire longer and thinner.

## How to create it

1.  **Prepare the Rod:** Forge or cast the metal into a thin rod or strip.
2.  **Anneal:** Heat the metal to soften it (as working it hardens it).
3.  **Draw:** Pull the rod through a "draw plate" – a hard plate (stone or harder metal) with a tapered hole.
4.  **Repeat:** Pull it through successively smaller holes until the desired thickness is reached.
5.  **Re-anneal:** If the wire becomes too brittle during the process, heat it again.

## Materials needed

-   **Ductile Metal:** Copper, gold, and silver are the easiest to work with. Iron and steel require more force.
-   **Draw Plate:** A plate made of a material harder than the wire (hardened steel, diamond, or hard stone).
-   **Lubricant:** Fat or wax to reduce friction during drawing.
-   **Tongs/Pliers:** To grip and pull the wire.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Stranded Wire:** Several thin wires twisted together (like rope) for better flexibility.
-   **Barbed Wire:** Wire with sharp points for fencing/defense.
-   **Magnet Wire:** Copper wire coated with a thin layer of insulation (enamel) for use in coils.

## Limits and risks

-   **Work Hardening:** Drawing metal makes it hard and brittle; without annealing, it will snap.
-   **Capacity:** Thin wires can melt if they carry too much electrical current (acting as a fuse).
-   **Corrosion:** Iron wire rusts quickly if not galvanized or coated.
