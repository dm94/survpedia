# Brief description

The escapement is the "heart" of a mechanical clock or watch. It is a mechanism that blocks the gear train and allows it to advance a fixed amount at each swing of the oscillator (pendulum or balance wheel). It serves two crucial functions: counting the oscillations and providing energy to keep the oscillator moving.

## Use / Function

-   **Regulation:** Controls the speed at which the clock's gears turn, ensuring accurate timekeeping.
-   **Energy Transfer:** Delivers a tiny push (impulse) to the pendulum or balance wheel to overcome friction and air resistance.
-   **Sound:** Creates the characteristic "tick-tock" sound of mechanical timepieces.

## Operating principle

The escapement converts the continuous rotational force of the gear train into the back-and-forth motion of the oscillator.

1.  **Lock:** A tooth of the escape wheel is caught by a pallet on the anchor or lever, stopping the gear train.
2.  **Impulse:** As the oscillator swings, it moves the pallet, unlocking the wheel. The wheel turns slightly, and a tooth pushes against the pallet, transferring energy to the oscillator.
3.  **Drop:** The tooth escapes the pallet, and the wheel turns freely for a brief moment until another tooth locks against the other pallet.
4.  **Repeat:** The process repeats with each swing.

## How to create it

Creating an escapement requires high precision. The geometry of the teeth and pallets is critical.

1.  **Escape Wheel:** Cut a wheel with specially shaped teeth (e.g., pointed for anchor, club-shaped for lever).
2.  **Pallets:** Fabricate the locking components (pallets). In high-quality watches, these are made of synthetic **[Ruby](/en/materials/ruby)** to reduce friction. In clocks, hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** is common.
3.  **Geometry:** Ensure the distance between the escape wheel center and the pallet axis is exact so that the locking and impulse actions occur correctly.

## Materials needed

-   **Escape Wheel:** **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)** (work-hardened) or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
-   **Pallets:** Hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Ruby](/en/materials/ruby)** (Jewels).
-   **Arbors:** Polished **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for low-friction pivoting.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Verge Escapement:** The earliest type, used with a foliot. High friction, low accuracy.
-   **Anchor Escapement:** Used in **[Pendulum Clocks](/en/inventions/pendulum-clock)**. Allows for a smaller pendulum swing and better accuracy.
-   **Deadbeat Escapement:** An improvement on the anchor that eliminates recoil, providing higher precision.
-   **Lever Escapement:** The standard for **[Mechanical Watches](/en/inventions/mechanical-watch)**. It is detached, meaning it only touches the balance wheel briefly, improving accuracy.
-   **Co-axial Escapement:** A modern invention reducing friction further.

## Limits and risks

-   **Friction:** Sliding friction between teeth and pallets requires lubrication (oil), which degrades over time.
-   **Wear:** The constant impact of teeth against pallets wears them down, changing the geometry and timing.
-   **Adjustment:** Extremely sensitive to position and alignment. A small error can stop the clock.
