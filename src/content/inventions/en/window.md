# Brief description

A window is an opening in a wall or roof that allows light and, if not fixed, air to pass through, while maintaining isolation from the outside.

## Use / Function

- **Natural Lighting:** Allows sunlight into the interior of buildings.
- **Ventilation:** If openable, allows air exchange.
- **Insulation:** Protects from wind, rain, and extreme temperatures (especially with glazing).
- **Visibility:** Allows viewing the outside without leaving.

## Operating principle

It relies on using a transparent or translucent material that physically blocks passage (wind, objects) but permits the passage of visible electromagnetic radiation (light).

## How to create it

- **Frame:** Build a rigid frame (wood or stone) that fits into the wall opening.
- **Sash (Optional):** A movable structure within the frame if opening is desired.
- **Glazing:** Fix the transparent material (glass, oiled paper) to the frame or sash using putty or beads.
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate. Requires precise carpentry and access to transparent materials.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Material for the frame (wood), transparent material (glass).
- **Tools:** Saw, hammer, chisel.
- **Substitutes:** Oiled paper, thin cloth, scraped animal skin (parchment), mica sheets, flattened horn.

## Variants and improvements

- **Simple Hole:** Only air and light, no protection (primitive).
- **Paper/Cloth Window:** Wind protection but poor thermal insulation (common in traditional Asia).
- **Single Glazing:** Good light passage and wind protection.
- **Double Glazing:** Two layers of glass with air in between for superior thermal insulation (modern).

## Limits and risks

- **Heat Loss:** It is the weakest point of a building's thermal insulation.
- **Fragility:** Glass is easily broken, posing a security risk and injury hazard.
- **Greenhouse Effect:** Can excessively heat the interior if receiving direct sunlight.
