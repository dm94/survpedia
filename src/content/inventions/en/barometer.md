# Brief description

A barometer is a scientific instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. It is a critical tool for predicting short-term weather changes and measuring altitude.

## Use / Function

- **Weather Forecasting:** High pressure generally indicates fair weather, while low pressure indicates storms. Rapid pressure drops are a warning sign.
- **Altimetry:** Measuring altitude above sea level (pressure decreases with height).
- **Scale:** Individual to Industrial.

## Operating principle

The atmosphere exerts weight (pressure) on the surface of the earth. A barometer balances this weight against a column of liquid (mercury or water) or a mechanical spring.
- **Mercury Barometer:** Atmospheric pressure pushes down on a reservoir of mercury, forcing it up a vacuum-sealed tube. The height of the column is directly proportional to the pressure.

## How to create it

### Torricellian Barometer
1.  **Materials:** A glass tube at least 80cm long (sealed at one end), a small bowl, and mercury.
2.  **Assembly:** Fill the tube completely with mercury to remove all air. Fill the bowl partly with mercury.
3.  **Inversion:** Place your thumb over the open end, invert the tube, and submerge the opening in the bowl of mercury before releasing your thumb.
4.  **Result:** The mercury will drop slightly, creating a vacuum at the top. The height of the column (usually around 760mm at sea level) represents the atmospheric pressure.

### Water Barometer (Goethe)
1.  **Materials:** A glass jar with a spout connected to the main body (like a teapot but sealed at the top).
2.  **Principle:** Traps a volume of air. When external pressure rises, it pushes water down the spout and into the body. When pressure falls, the trapped air pushes water up the spout.

- **Technical level:** Advanced (Mercury) to Basic (Water/Goethe).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Glass tubing, liquid (mercury is standard, water requires a 10m tube for accuracy or a Goethe design for relative changes).
- **Tools:** Heat source for sealing glass.
- **Substitutes:** An aneroid barometer uses a flexible metal box with a vacuum inside, which expands/contracts with pressure (requires precision machining).

## Variants and improvements

- **Aneroid Barometer:** Non-liquid, uses a metal cell. More durable and portable.
- **Barograph:** Records pressure changes over time on a paper chart.
- **Storm Glass:** A chemical mixture (camphor, alcohol, etc.) that crystallizes differently based on weather (though accuracy is debated).

## Limits and risks

- **Toxicity:** Mercury is extremely toxic. Handled with great care.
- **Fragility:** Glass tubes break easily.
- **Temperature:** Readings must be corrected for temperature, as liquids expand with heat.
