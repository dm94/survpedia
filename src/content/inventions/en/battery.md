# Battery (Electric Cell)

A device that converts stored chemical energy into electrical energy. It allows for portable power and the operation of electrical devices without a continuous connection to a generator.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Providing electrical current to portable devices (flashlights, radios).
- **Secondary uses**: Starting motors, electrolysis, electroplating.
- **Scale**: Domestic to Industrial.

## Operating principle

**Electrochemical Redox Reaction**:
Two different metals (electrodes) are placed in an electrolyte (conductive liquid).
1.  **Anode (Negative)**: The metal that oxidizes (loses electrons), typically Zinc or Lead.
2.  **Cathode (Positive)**: The metal that reduces (gains electrons), typically Copper or Lead Dioxide.
3.  **Electrolyte**: Allows ions to flow between electrodes to balance the charge, while electrons flow through the external circuit.

Example: In a Zinc-Copper voltaic pile, Zinc dissolves into the electrolyte, releasing electrons that flow through the wire to the Copper.

## How to create it

### 1. Voltaic Pile (Simple)
- **Level**: Basic.
- **Structure**: A stack of "cells".
- **Cell**: One disc of Copper, one disc of cloth soaked in brine (salty water) or vinegar, and one disc of Zinc.
- **Stacking**: Copper - Cloth - Zinc - Copper - Cloth - Zinc...
- **Output**: More layers = higher voltage.

### 2. Lead-Acid (Rechargeable)
- **Level**: Intermediate.
- **Plates**: Lead plates (Anode) and Lead Dioxide plates (Cathode). You can make Lead Dioxide by oxidizing lead plates (charging a plain lead battery repeatedly).
- **Electrolyte**: Dilute Sulfuric Acid (approx 30%).
- **Container**: Acid-resistant (Glass, Ceramic, Plastic).

## Materials needed

- **Electrodes**: Zinc and Copper (for primary cells), or Lead (for secondary/rechargeable cells).
- **Electrolyte**: Salt water, Vinegar, or Sulfuric Acid.
- **Separator**: Cloth, cardboard, or porous paper (to prevent short circuits between plates).
- **Container**: Non-conductive and non-reactive (Glass/Ceramic).

## Variants and improvements

- **Daniell Cell**: Uses two electrolytes (Copper sulfate and Zinc sulfate) separated by a porous pot. Reduces hydrogen buildup (polarization) making it last longer.
- **Baghdad Battery**: Hypothetical ancient variant using an iron rod inside a copper cylinder with grape juice/vinegar.

## Limits and risks

- **Capacity**: Early batteries have low capacity and voltage drops quickly under load.
- **Corrosion**: The electrolyte often eats the electrodes even when not in use.
- **Hydrogen Gas**: Lead-acid batteries produce explosive hydrogen gas when charging.
- **Acid Burns**: Sulfuric acid is dangerous.
