A stone knife is one of the earliest tools made by humans, used for cutting meat, hides, and other materials.

## Manufacturing

1. **Selection of material**: A high-quality flint or obsidian core is selected.
2. **Knapping**: Small flakes are removed using a hammerstone or antler to create a sharp edge.
3. **Hafting**: The blade is attached to a wooden or bone handle using resin and sinew.

## Importance

Crucial for survival, allowing early humans to process food and materials more efficiently.
