# Brief description

A road surfacing method using rectangular wooden blocks, usually set with the grain vertical (end-grain), placed on a solid foundation. It was popular in 19th-century cities for being quieter and smoother than cobblestones.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Urban street paving to reduce noise from horses' hooves and iron carriage wheels.
- **Secondary uses:** Interior industrial flooring (absorbs impact), bridge decks (lighter than stone).
- **Scale:** City streets, bridges, factory floors.

## Operating principle

- **Shock Absorption:** Wood is softer than stone, cushioning impacts and dampening sound.
- **End-Grain Durability:** Placing wood blocks with the grain vertical makes them much more resistant to wear and splitting than placing them flat.
- **Traction:** Provides good grip when dry, though can be slippery when wet.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundation:** Prepare a stable base. Historically, this was often a layer of [planks](/en/materials/wood) or, better, a [concrete](/en/materials/concrete) slab.
2.  **Preparation:** Cut [wood](/en/materials/wood) into uniform rectangular blocks (e.g., 15x8x15 cm). Hardwoods or resinous softwoods are best.
3.  **Treatment:** Dip blocks in boiling [tar](/en/materials/tar) or [creosote](/en/materials/tar) to preserve them and prevent rot.
4.  **Laying:** Place blocks in rows on the foundation with the end grain facing up. Leave small gaps (2-3 mm) between rows for expansion.
5.  **Jointing:** Pour hot [tar](/en/materials/tar) or [bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen) into the gaps and cover with fine [gravel](/en/materials/gravel) or [sand](/en/materials/sand) to seal the surface and provide grip.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Blocks of pine, oak, or cedar.
  - **[Tar](/en/materials/tar) / [Bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen):** Preservative and sealant.
- **Foundation:**
  - **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** or **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel)** base.
- **Tools:**
  - **[Saw](/en/inventions/saw):** For cutting blocks.
  - **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer):** For setting blocks.

## Variants and improvements

- **Nicholson Pavement:** An early US version using a plank foundation and tar.
- **Creosoted Blocks:** Pressure-treated wood for longer life against rot.
- **Interior Block Paving:** Used in factories to protect dropped tools and reduce worker fatigue.

## Limits and risks

- **Slippery when wet:** Became notoriously slippery for horses in rain.
- **Expansion:** Wood swells when wet; if not spaced correctly, the road surface could buckle or push over curbstones.
- **Sanitation:** Wood is porous and absorbs urine and waste from animals, leading to bad smells in warm weather.
- **Rot:** Even with tar, wood eventually decays.
