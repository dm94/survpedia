# Brief description

The fundamental techniques for processing medicinal plants into stable, usable forms. Raw plants often rot or are difficult to dose; processing them into extracts, tinctures, and ointments concentrates their properties and preserves them for long-term use.

## Use / Function

-   **Preservation**: Keeping medicinal properties active for months or years.
-   **Concentration**: Increasing the potency of the medicine.
-   **Application**: Making it easier to apply to skin (ointments) or ingest (tinctures).
-   **Scale**: Domestic to Village Apothecary.

## Operating principle

-   **Extraction**: Using a solvent (water, alcohol, oil, fat) to pull the active chemical compounds out of the plant fiber.
-   **Stabilization**: The solvent usually acts as a preservative (alcohol inhibits bacteria, fat protects from air).

## How to create it

### 1. Water Infusion (Tea)
The simplest form. Steeping fresh or dried herbs in hot water.
-   **Pros**: Fast, easy.
-   **Cons**: Spoils within 24 hours.

### 2. Tincture (Alcohol Extract)
Soaking dried plant material in strong alcohol (40%+) for 2-6 weeks, then straining.
-   **Process**:
    1. Fill a jar 1/2 full with dried herbs.
    2. Cover completely with **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** (vodka or moonshine).
    3. Seal and shake daily for a month.
    4. Strain through cloth.
-   **Shelf life**: Years.

### 3. Oil Infusion
Heating herbs in vegetable oil to extract fat-soluble compounds.
-   **Process**:
    1. Mix dried herbs with **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**.
    2. Heat gently (do not fry!) for several hours.
    3. Strain.
-   **Shelf life**: 6-12 months (until oil goes rancid).

### 4. Ointment / Salve
Solidifying an oil infusion with wax or fat for topical application.
-   **Process**:
    1. Take warm Oil Infusion.
    2. Melt in **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** (approx. 1 part wax to 4 parts oil).
    3. Pour into small containers to harden.

## Materials needed

-   **Essential**: **[Medicinal Plants](/en/materials/medicinal-plants)**.
-   **Solvents**: Water, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**, or **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**.
-   **Thickener**: **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** (for salves).
-   **Tools**: **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, cloth for filtering.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Poultice**: Mashed fresh herbs applied directly to skin (immediate use).
-   **Syrup**: Tincture or strong tea mixed with sugar/honey (good for coughs).
-   **Essential Oils**: Steam distillation (requires **[Alembic](/en/inventions/alembic)**) to get highly concentrated volatile oils.

## Limits and risks

-   **Dosage**: Homemade medicines have variable strength. Start with small doses.
-   **Identification**: Using the wrong plant can be fatal.
-   **Solvent Safety**: Do not use denatured (poisonous) alcohol for internal medicines. Use only food-grade ethanol.
