# Brief description

Painting walls is the process of preparing a wall surface and applying paint to seal, protect, and color it. It combines surface preparation (plaster, filler, or limewash) with controlled application using brushes to achieve an even, durable finish.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Protect and color interior or exterior walls.
- **Secondary uses**: Reflect light, improve cleanliness, and mark zones or signage.
- **Scale**: Domestic to large buildings.

## Operating principle

Paint forms a thin film that bonds to the wall surface. Porous walls absorb moisture and binder; priming or plastering evens absorption so the paint cures uniformly. Multiple thin coats interlock and reduce cracking or peeling.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

1.  Clean dust and loose material from the wall.
2.  Mix **[paint](/en/materials/paint)** to a brushable consistency with **[water](/en/materials/water)** if needed.
3.  Apply an even coat with a **[brush](/en/inventions/brush)**.
4.  Let it dry fully before use.

### Essential steps

1.  **Repair and clean**: Fill cracks with **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** or **[gypsum](/en/materials/gypsum)** and remove chalking surfaces.
2.  **Level and seal**: Apply a thin **[lime](/en/materials/lime)** wash or fine plaster to reduce suction.
3.  **Mix paint**: Adjust viscosity so it spreads without running.
4.  **Cut in**: Use a brush to paint edges, corners, and trim.
5.  **Cover the field**: Apply the main coat in consistent strokes.
6.  **Second coat**: Apply after full drying for uniform color and durability.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Paint](/en/materials/paint)** or **[pigments](/en/materials/pigments)** with binder
  - **[Water](/en/materials/water)**
  - **[Gypsum](/en/materials/gypsum)** or **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** for leveling
  - **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)** for whitewash or sealing
  - **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** for filler or render
  - **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** or **[wood](/en/materials/wood)** as substrate
- **Tools**: **[Brush](/en/inventions/brush)**, mixing bucket, stirring stick, trowel, cloths.
- **Possible substitutes**:
  - **Colored clay or mud**: Short-lived wall coloring.
  - **Limewash**: **[lime](/en/materials/lime)** and water for a breathable, cheap finish.

## Variants and improvements

- **Limewash**: Breathable coating for masonry.
- **Fresco**: Pigment applied onto wet **[lime](/en/materials/lime)** plaster.
- **Distemper**: **[paint](/en/materials/paint)** with animal glue binder for interiors.
- **Modern acrylics**: Durable, quick drying, and washable.

## Limits and risks

- **Peeling**: Poor surface preparation or moisture behind the wall.
- **Cracking**: Coats applied too thick or on unstable plaster.
- **Mold**: Trapped moisture in poorly ventilated rooms.
- **Toxicity**: Solvent fumes and hazardous pigments require ventilation.
- **Falls and dust**: Ladders, sanding, and scraping are injury and respiratory risks.
