# Brief description

The fire plow is a friction method where a stick is rubbed along a groove in a board to generate heat and create an ember.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Produce an ember for fire starting.
- **Secondary uses:** Demonstrates efficient friction techniques with minimal tools.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

Repeated rubbing concentrates friction heat in a wooden groove. The resulting fine dust accumulates at the end of the groove and ignites into a glowing ember.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare the board:** Use a soft, dry board and cut a straight groove.
2. **Prepare the plow stick:** Harder wood with a blunt, rounded tip.
3. **Plow:** Push the stick rapidly along the groove to build heat.
4. **Ember:** Continue until the dust pile glows. Transfer to tinder.
5. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Softwood board, harder plow stick, tinder bundle.
- **Tools:** Knife or sharp stone to cut the groove.
- **Substitutes:** Bow drill if available for faster ignition.

## Variants and improvements

- **Double groove:** Allows two users alternating to reduce fatigue.
- **Preheated board:** Warming the board improves ignition speed.
- **Longer groove:** Provides more dust and heat buildup.

## Limits and risks

- **High effort:** Requires sustained speed and pressure.
- **Humidity:** Fails in damp conditions.
- **Slipping:** Poor grip can reduce heat generation.
