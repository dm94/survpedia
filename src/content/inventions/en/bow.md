# Brief description

A bow is a flexible weapon that projects aerodynamic projectiles called arrows. It consists of an elastic arc with a string connecting its two ends. It is one of the most effective ancient tools for hunting and long-range combat.

## Use / Function

- **Hunting**: Allows striking prey from a distance, reducing the risk to the hunter and increasing the success rate.
- **Defense/Warfare**: Provides range advantage against adversaries.
- **Sport**: Archery for skill and accuracy training.

## Operating principle

The bow functions as a spring. As the archer draws the string back, energy is stored in the limbs of the bow as elastic potential energy. When the string is released, this energy is rapidly transferred to the arrow, propelling it forward with high velocity.

## How to create it

1.  **Stave Selection**: Find a piece of wood that is flexible but strong (e.g., yew, ash, hickory, or elm). It should be about the height of the archer.
2.  **Shaping**: Remove bark. Carve the belly (the side facing the archer) flat and leave the back (the side facing away) natural (following a single growth ring is best). Taper the limbs towards the ends so they bend evenly.
3.  **Nocking**: Cut small grooves (nocks) at both ends of the stave to hold the string.
4.  **Stringing**: Twist plant fibers, sinew, or **[rawhide](/en/materials/leather)** to create a strong cord. Loop it over the nocks. The string should be shorter than the bow to maintain tension.

## Materials needed

- **Wood**: Flexible and resilient (e.g., Yew, Ash, Elm, Hickory).
- **String Material**: Plant fibers (hemp, linen), animal sinew, or **[rawhide](/en/materials/leather)** strips.
- **Tools**: Knife, scraper, stone for sanding.

## Variants and improvements

- **Self Bow**: Made from a single piece of wood.
- **Composite Bow**: Made from layers of horn, wood, and sinew laminated together; more powerful and compact.
- **Recurve Bow**: Tips curve away from the archer, storing more energy.

## Limits and risks

- **Moisture**: Can warp the wood or stretch the string (especially if natural).
- **Overdrawing**: Drawing the bow too far can break the limbs.
- **Dry Firing**: Releasing the string without an arrow transfers all energy back into the bow, potentially shattering it.
