# Brief description

A **Bearing** is a machine element that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between moving parts. It is essential for any machine with rotating shafts, such as [Wheels](/en/inventions/wheel), [Gears](/en/inventions/gears), and engines.

## Use / Function

- **Support Rotation:** Holds rotating shafts (axles) in place while allowing them to spin freely.
- **Reduce Friction:** Minimizes energy loss and heat generation by replacing sliding friction with rolling friction or using low-friction surfaces.
- **Load Handling:** Supports radial loads (perpendicular to the shaft) and axial loads (thrust along the shaft).
- **Positioning:** Keeps moving parts precisely aligned.

## Operating principle

Bearings work by separating moving surfaces.

- **Plain Bearings:** Use a smooth, low-friction surface (like polished bronze or oil-soaked wood) and a lubricant to allow the shaft to slide easily.
- **Rolling-Element Bearings:** Place balls or rollers between two rings (races). The rolling action generates much less friction than sliding.

## How to create it

### Plain Bearing (Bushings)

1.  **Material Selection:** Choose a material softer than the shaft but durable, such as **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, or dense **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** (like Lignum Vitae).
2.  **Shaping:** machine a cylinder (bushing) that fits tightly into the housing and has a smooth inner bore that fits the shaft with a small clearance.
3.  **Lubrication:** Add grooves or holes to introduce **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** or **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** into the contact area.

### Rolling-Element Bearing (Advanced)

1.  **Races:** Create inner and outer rings from hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**. They must be perfectly circular and smooth.
2.  **Rolling Elements:** Create perfectly spherical balls or cylindrical rollers from hardened steel.
3.  **Cage:** Make a separator (cage) to keep the balls/rollers evenly spaced.
4.  **Assembly:** Place the balls between the races and seal with grease.

## Materials needed

- **Bearing Material:** Bronze, Babbitt metal, Cast Iron, Hardwood.
- **Rolling Elements:** High-carbon Steel (hardened).
- **Lubricant:** Grease, Oil, Graphite.

## Variants and improvements

- **Journal Bearing:** A simple plain bearing for radial loads.
- **Thrust Bearing:** Designed to support axial loads (e.g., a propeller shaft).
- **Ball Bearing:** Uses balls for low friction at high speeds.
- **Roller Bearing:** Uses cylinders for higher load capacity.
- **Tapered Roller Bearing:** Handles both radial and thrust loads.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction/Heat:** If lubrication fails, the bearing will overheat and seize (weld itself to the shaft).
- **Wear:** Over time, surfaces wear down, causing "play" (looseness) and vibration.
- **Contamination:** Dirt and dust ruin bearings quickly; seals are essential.
- **Load Limits:** Exceeding the load rating will deform the rolling elements (brinelling).
