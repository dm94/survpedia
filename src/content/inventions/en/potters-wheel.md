# Brief description

The potter's wheel is a machine used in the shaping (known as throwing) of round [ceramic](/en/materials/ceramics) ware, specifically **[Pottery](/en/inventions/pottery)**. It allows for the rapid production of symmetrical vessels such as pots, bowls, and vases with uniform wall thickness.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Rapid shaping of clay into symmetrical round forms (vessels, plates, bowls).
- **Secondary uses:** Trimming and decorating dried ceramic ware.
- **Scale:** From individual artisan production to mass production in workshops.

## Operating principle

The potter's wheel relies on the principles of **angular momentum** and **centrifugal force** to enable the shaping of clay.

1.  **Energy Storage (Flywheel Effect):** A heavy flywheel (or the wheelhead itself if heavy enough) is set into motion. Its mass and radius create significant moment of inertia, storing kinetic energy.
2.  **Smooth Rotation:** This stored energy allows the wheel to continue spinning at a relatively constant speed even when the potter applies friction/pressure to the clay. This is crucial for consistent shaping.
3.  **Centering:** The rotation allows the potter to exert force towards the center, forcing the clay into a perfectly symmetrical lump (centering).
4.  **Shaping (Throwing):** As the clay spins, the potter applies pressure. The centrifugal force naturally pushes the clay outwards, while the potter's hands constrain it. The balance between these forces allows the walls of the vessel to be pulled up and thinned evenly.

## How to create it

### Kick Wheel (Traditional)

1.  **Frame:** Build a sturdy wooden frame or bench that allows the potter to sit comfortably above the mechanism.
2.  **Axle:** Install a vertical shaft ([axle](/en/inventions/axle)) made of hard wood or metal. It needs to rotate freely but without wobbling.
3.  **Flywheel:** Attach a heavy, balanced [wheel](/en/inventions/wheel) (stone or heavy wood) to the bottom of the axle. This acts as the flywheel to store momentum.
4.  **Wheelhead:** Attach a flat, circular disk to the top of the axle. This is where the clay will be placed.
5.  **Bearings:** Use greased **[leather](/en/materials/leather)** or stone sockets as bearings for the axle to minimize friction.

## Materials needed

- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** For the frame, bench, axle, and wheelhead.
- **[Stone](/en/materials/stone):** For the flywheel (weight is crucial) and potentially for the bottom bearing.
- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**/Grease:\*\* For lubricating the contact points (bearings).
- **[Clay](/en/materials/clay):** To test and use the wheel!

## Variants and improvements

- **Hand-turned wheel:** A simple turntable turned by hand or by an assistant. No flywheel effect.
- **Kick wheel:** The potter kicks a heavy flywheel at their feet to maintain momentum. Allows both hands to be free.
- **Treadle wheel:** Uses a reciprocating motion (like a sewing machine) converted to rotation.
- **Electric wheel:** Uses an electric motor for constant speed and torque.

## Limits and risks

- **Physical strain:** Using a kick wheel requires physical effort and coordination.
- **Learning curve:** "Throwing" on a wheel requires significant skill and practice to center the clay and pull up walls without collapsing them.
- **Maintenance:** Bearings need regular lubrication; wood can warp if constantly wet.
