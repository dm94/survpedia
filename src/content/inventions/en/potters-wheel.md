# Brief description

The potter's wheel is a machine used in the shaping (known as throwing) of round ceramic ware. It allows for the rapid production of symmetrical vessels such as pots, bowls, and vases with uniform wall thickness.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Rapid shaping of clay into symmetrical round forms (vessels, plates, bowls).
- **Secondary uses:** Trimming and decorating dried ceramic ware.
- **Scale:** From individual artisan production to mass production in workshops.

## Operating principle

The core principle is **rotational symmetry** combined with **angular momentum**.
A heavy flywheel (kick wheel) or a powered mechanism rotates a flat disk (wheelhead) horizontally. The inertia of the flywheel keeps the rotation smooth and consistent even when resistance is applied by the potter's hands against the clay. The centrifugal force helps in opening and shaping the clay.

## How to create it

### Kick Wheel (Traditional)

1.  **Frame:** Build a sturdy wooden frame or bench that allows the potter to sit comfortably above the mechanism.
2.  **Axle:** Install a vertical shaft (axle) made of hard wood or metal. It needs to rotate freely but without wobbling.
3.  **Flywheel:** Attach a heavy, balanced wheel (stone or heavy wood) to the bottom of the axle. This acts as the flywheel to store momentum.
4.  **Wheelhead:** Attach a flat, circular disk to the top of the axle. This is where the clay will be placed.
5.  **Bearings:** Use greased **[leather](/en/materials/leather)** or stone sockets as bearings for the axle to minimize friction.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** For the frame, bench, axle, and wheelhead.
- **Stone:** For the flywheel (weight is crucial) and potentially for the bottom bearing.
- **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**/Grease:\*\* For lubricating the contact points (bearings).
- **Clay:** To test and use the wheel!

## Variants and improvements

- **Hand-turned wheel:** A simple turntable turned by hand or by an assistant. No flywheel effect.
- **Kick wheel:** The potter kicks a heavy flywheel at their feet to maintain momentum. Allows both hands to be free.
- **Treadle wheel:** Uses a reciprocating motion (like a sewing machine) converted to rotation.
- **Electric wheel:** Uses an electric motor for constant speed and torque.

## Limits and risks

- **Physical strain:** Using a kick wheel requires physical effort and coordination.
- **Learning curve:** "Throwing" on a wheel requires significant skill and practice to center the clay and pull up walls without collapsing them.
- **Maintenance:** Bearings need regular lubrication; wood can warp if constantly wet.
