# Brief description

A machine used in the shaping (throwing) of round ceramic ware. The wheel may also be used during the process of trimming the excess body from dried ware, and for applying incised decoration or rings of color.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** To quickly and symmetrically shape round clay vessels (pots, bowls, plates) which is much faster than coiling.
- **Secondary Uses:** Trimming, decoration.
- **Scale:** From small, foot-powered (kick wheels) to large electric industrial wheels.

## Operating principle

The potter throws a lump of prepared **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** onto the center of the wheel head. As the wheel spins rapidly, the potter uses their hands to center the clay, open it, pull up the walls, and shape the vessel, exploiting centrifugal force and friction.

## How to create it

### Simple Kick Wheel

1.  **Wheel Head:** A flat, circular disk (wood or metal) on top of a vertical shaft.
2.  **Shaft (Axle):** Connects the wheel head to the flywheel. Supported by **[Slide Bearings](/en/inventions/slide-bearings)** or **[Ball and Roller Bearings](/en/inventions/ball-and-roller-bearing)**.
3.  **Flywheel:** A heavy disk (often **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, concrete, or wood weighted with **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**) attached to the bottom of the shaft. Its momentum keeps the wheel spinning smoothly.
4.  **Frame:** A sturdy wooden or metal frame to hold the shaft vertical and provide a seat/bench for the potter.
5.  **Kick Bar:** (Optional) A lever mechanism to kick the flywheel, or simply kick the flywheel directly with the foot.

## Materials needed

- **Heavy Mass (Flywheel):** **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, or **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** weights.
- **Shaft:** Strong **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** / **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** rod.
- **Bearings:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** (greased), **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, or steel ball bearings.
- **Frame:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Tournette:** A simple turntable used for coiling, not throwing (slow rotation).
- **Kick Wheel:** Foot-powered, heavy flywheel provides momentum.
- **Treadle Wheel:** Foot pedal drives a crankshaft to spin the flywheel.
- **Electric Wheel:** Motor-driven, consistent speed control (pedal).

## Limits and risks

- **Centering:** Requires skill to center the clay perfectly; uncentered clay wobbles and collapses.
- **Speed:** Too fast and the clay flies off; too slow and it drags.
- **Physical Strain:** Kick wheels can be tiring for the leg/back.
