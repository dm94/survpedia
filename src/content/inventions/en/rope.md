# Brief description

Rope is a flexible tool made of braided or twisted fibers to form a single line capable of resisting tensile stress.

## Use / Function

- **Fastening:** Tying objects or structures together.
- **Traction:** Dragging heavy loads.
- **Construction:** Fundamental in scaffolding and suspension bridges.
- **Transport:** Used in navigation (sails) and pulleys.

## Operating principle

Twisting individual fibers increases the friction between them. When tension is applied, the fibers squeeze more tightly against each other, preventing them from sliding and allowing the rope to support a much greater load than the sum of its individual fibers.

## How to create it

1. Collect long, strong fibers.
2. Group the fibers and twist them in one direction.
3. Join two or more twisted groups and let them coil around each other in the opposite direction (counter-twist).

## Materials needed

- **Plant fibers:** Hemp, flax, jute, sisal.
- **Animal:** Leather strips, wool, horsehair.
- **Substitutes:** Flexible roots or vines in emergency situations.

## Variants and improvements

- **Cord:** Thin version for domestic uses.
- **Cable/Hawser:** Very thick rope for ships.
- **Synthetic ropes:** Modern versions made of nylon or polypropylene, resistant to rot.

## Limits and risks

- **Breakage:** Exceeding the maximum working load.
- **Degradation:** Moisture can rot natural fibers; sun damages synthetic ones.
- **Friction:** Wear against rough surfaces weakens the structure.
