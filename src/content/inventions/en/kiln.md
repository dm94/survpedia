# Brief description

A kiln or oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for heating, baking, or drying substances. It is essential for cooking, pottery, and metallurgy.

## Use / Function

- **Food Preparation:** Baking bread and cooking food.
- **[Pottery](/en/inventions/pottery):** Firing [clay](/en/materials/clay) to create [ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics).
- **Metallurgy:** Smelting ores and melting metals.
- **Manufacturing:** Creating [bricks](/en/materials/brick) and [lime](/en/materials/lime).

## Operating principle

The kiln works by confining heat within an insulated space. By controlling the flow of air (oxygen) and fuel, very high temperatures can be achieved and maintained, far exceeding those of an open fire.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundation:** Create a stable base of stone or earth.
2.  **Chamber:** Build walls using heat-resistant materials like clay bricks or stone.
3.  **Insulation:** Coat the exterior with thick layers of mud or clay to prevent heat loss.
4.  **Airflow:** Incorporate an intake for air (bellows can be used) and an exhaust (chimney).
5.  **Loading:** Create an opening for placing items and fuel, which can be sealed during operation.

## Materials needed

- **Structure:** [Clay](/en/materials/clay), mud, firebricks, or heat-resistant [stones](/en/materials/stone).
- **Binding:** Wet [clay](/en/materials/clay) or [mortar](/en/materials/mortar).
- **Fuel:** [Wood](/en/materials/wood), [charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal), or [coal](/en/materials/coal).
- **Tools:** Shovels, tongs, and potentially bellows for higher temperatures.

## Variants and improvements

- **Earth Oven:** A simple pit in the ground.
- **Brick Oven:** Durable structure for consistent baking.
- **Updraft Kiln:** Heat flows from the bottom through the items and out the top.
- **Blast Furnace:** Uses forced air to reach temperatures high enough for iron smelting.

## Limits and risks

- **Structural Failure:** Extreme heat can crack or collapse the walls.
- **Toxic Fumes:** Carbon monoxide and other gases can build up in poorly ventilated areas.
- **Fire Hazard:** High temperatures can ignite nearby flammable materials.
- **Temperature Control:** Difficult to maintain precise temperatures without modern sensors.
