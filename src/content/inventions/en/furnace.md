# Brief description

A furnace is a device used for high-temperature heating. Unlike a **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)** which bakes or dries materials (like ceramics), a furnace is typically used to melt metals (smelting), melt glass, or burn fuel to generate heat for other processes.

## Use / Function

- **Smelting:** Extracting metal from ore (e.g., iron, copper).
- **Melting:** Liquefying metals for casting (foundry furnace).
- **Glassmaking:** Melting sand and other ingredients into glass.
- **Heating:** Providing heat for a building or steam engine.

## Operating principle

Furnaces operate by containing an extremely hot fire within a refractory (heat-resistant) chamber.

- **Fuel:** Uses high-energy fuels like **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**, coal, or coke.
- **Air Blast:** Most high-temperature furnaces (like Blast Furnaces) use **[Bellows](/en/inventions/bellows)** to pump in air (oxygen), increasing the combustion rate and temperature significantly beyond what a natural draft can achieve.

## How to create it

1.  **Refractory Lining:** Build a vertical shaft or chamber using heat-resistant materials (fireclay, sandstone, firebrick). Ordinary stone may explode or crumble.
2.  **Air Intake (Tuyere):** Install a pipe or nozzle at the bottom to inject air from bellows.
3.  **Charging:** Load fuel and ore in alternating layers from the top (for shaft furnaces).
4.  **Tapping:** Create a hole at the bottom to tap out the molten metal and slag.

## Materials needed

- **Structure:** **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** mixed with sand/grog, or Firebrick.
- **Fuel:** **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** is the historical standard; Coke for modern blast furnaces.
- **Flux:** Limestone (to remove impurities/slag).

## Variants and improvements

- **Bloomery:** Primitive iron furnace that produces a solid sponge of iron (bloom), not liquid.
- **Blast Furnace:** Tall shaft furnace with forced air that melts iron completely (cast iron).
- **Cupola Furnace:** Used to remelt cast iron.
- **Reverberatory Furnace:** Fuel and material are separated; heat reflects off the roof onto the material.

## Limits and risks

- **Temperature:** Reaching the melting point of iron (1538°C) is very difficult without efficient bellows and fuel.
- **Explosions:** Molten metal contacting water causes steam explosions.
- **Carbon Monoxide:** Incomplete combustion produces deadly gas.
