# Brief description

A wolf pen trap is a large corral-style trap that funnels a predator into an enclosed pen and prevents escape with a one-way gate or drop door.

## Use / Function

- **Predator control:** Protects livestock and storage areas.
- **Live capture:** Allows relocation if regulations require non-lethal methods.
- **Deterrence:** Disrupts hunting routes near settlements.
- **Scale:** Small group or community build.

## Operating principle

A funnel of fences or walls guides the animal toward a narrow opening. The gate closes behind the animal or only opens inward, while high walls and inward-leaning tops prevent climbing. Bait or a dragged scent line encourages entry and keeps the animal moving into the pen.

## How to create it

1. **Choose a site:** Pick a travel corridor with fresh tracks and enough space for a funnel and pen.
2. **Lay out the funnel:** Build two converging fences that guide the animal to the entrance.
3. **Build the pen:** Use a **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** palisade or **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** wall at least chest height with an inward lean.
4. **Install the gate:** A heavy drop door or inward-swinging gate secured with **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** hinges or a weighted bar.
5. **Add the trigger:** A treadle or trip line releases the gate when the animal crosses.
6. **Guide and bait:** Use brush to hide the funnel and place bait deep inside the pen.
7. **Check often:** Inspect at dawn and dusk, then secure the animal or reset the trap.

Technical level: Intermediate carpentry and safe handling of large animals.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** stakes and rails, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** for ballast or walls, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for lashings, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** for hinges or bars.
- **Tools:** Axe, saw, shovel, hammer, rope or cordage maker.
- **Substitutes:** Dry-stacked stone walls instead of timber, rawhide lashings instead of metal fasteners.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pit-assisted pen:** A shallow pit inside the pen reduces jumping ability.
- **Double gate:** A second inner gate for safer handling.
- **Snow pen:** Lower walls reinforced with snow and ice in winter.
- **Roofed pen:** Crossbeams and brush to reduce climbing escapes.

## Limits and risks

- **Labor intensive:** Requires many materials and time to build.
- **Non-target capture:** Can trap dogs or protected wildlife.
- **Safety:** Large predators can injure builders or livestock if mishandled.
- **Legal limits:** Many regions restrict or ban predator trapping.
