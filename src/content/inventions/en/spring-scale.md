# Brief description

Weighing device that measures the weight of an object based on the elastic deformation of a spring. It is compact, robust, and easy to use, though less accurate than a beam balance for fine trade.

## Use / Function

- **Trade and Logistics:** Weighing sacks, fish, luggage.
- **Industrial:** Measuring forces (dynamometer).
- **Home:** Kitchen or bathroom scales.

## Operating principle

Based on **Hooke's Law**: the extension (or compression) of a spring is directly proportional to the force (weight) applied to it, provided the elastic limit is not exceeded.
The spring moves a pointer over a graduated scale.

## How to create it

1.  **Spring:** Coil a tempered steel wire to form a helical spring.
2.  **Body:** A tube or box containing the spring.
3.  **Hook:** One end to hang the object.
4.  **Scale:** Calibrate by marking positions with known weights.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** High-carbon steel (for the spring), Iron or Brass (body and hooks).
- **Tools:** Pliers, metal tempering tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dynamometer:** Calibrated in Newtons to measure force instead of mass.
- **Compression Scale:** The weight compresses the spring (e.g., bathroom scale).

## Limits and risks

- **Metal Fatigue:** With excessive use, the spring may lose tension and accuracy.
- **Temperature:** Heat can alter the elasticity of steel.
- **Gravity:** Measures weight (force), not mass; the reading varies slightly with local gravity (altitude/latitude), unlike a counterbalance scale.
