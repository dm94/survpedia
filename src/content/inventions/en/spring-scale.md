# Brief description

A spring scale, or spring balance, is a type of weighing scale. It consists of a spring fixed at one end with a hook to attach an object at the other.

## Use / Function

- **Weighing:** Measuring the weight (force of gravity) of an object.
- **Force Measurement:** Measuring force in physics experiments (Newton meter).
- **Commerce:** Weighing produce or goods (often hanging scales).
- **Scale:** Personal to Industrial.

## Operating principle

It works on **Hooke's Law**, which states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance is proportional to that distance.

- As weight is applied, the spring stretches.
- A pointer attached to the spring moves along a calibrated scale to indicate the weight.

## How to create it

1.  **Spring Selection:** Choose a spring with an appropriate stiffness (spring constant) for the desired weight range.
2.  **Housing:** Create a tube or frame to hold the spring and protect it.
3.  **Pointer:** Attach a marker to the moving end of the spring.
4.  **Calibration:**
    - Mark the zero point with no load.
    - Hang a known weight and mark that point.
    - Divide the distance linearly (assuming a linear spring).

- **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Metal coil spring (steel).
- **Tools:** Pliers, marking tools, standard weights.

## Variants and improvements

- **Tubular:** Compact, cylindrical design.
- **Dial Scale:** The linear motion is converted to a rotary motion (clock-face) via a rack and pinion.
- **Dynamometer:** Designed specifically for measuring force/tension.

## Limits and risks

- **Elastic Limit:** If overloaded, the spring can permanently deform, ruining the scale.
- **Gravity:** Measures weight, not mass. Readings vary slightly with gravity (altitude/location).
- **Temperature:** Extreme heat can affect the spring's elasticity.
