# Brief description

A fishing lure is an artificial attractor used to provoke strikes by mimicking the movement, flash, or silhouette of prey. It replaces or enhances natural bait on a line.

## Use / Function

- **Attraction**: Triggers curiosity or feeding response through motion or shine.
- **Targeting**: Size and profile help select fish species.
- **Efficiency**: Reusable and less dependent on fresh bait.

## Operating principle

A lure creates stimulus patterns such as vibration, wobble, or glint that fish interpret as prey. When paired with a **[Fishing Hook](/en/inventions/fishing-hook)**, the strike sets the hook as tension is applied through the line.

## How to create it

1. **Shape the body**: Carve **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** into a small fish or insect profile.
2. **Add weight or balance**: Adjust thickness and carve a tapered belly for stable wobble.
3. **Attach the hook**: Lash or wire an **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** hook to the body.
4. **Create movement**: Cut a shallow lip or angled face to make it dive and oscillate.
5. **Seal and protect**: Coat with **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** to reduce water absorption.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Wood or bone body, iron hook.
- **Binding**: **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for lashings.
- **Tools**: Knife, awl, file, small drill, fire for hardening.
- **Substitutes**: Thorn or sharpened bone point for a hook, carved shell for body.

## Variants and improvements

- **Floating lure**: Lightweight body that stays near the surface.
- **Sinking lure**: Weighted body for deeper water.
- **Spinner**: Thin metal blade that flashes when pulled.
- **Feathered lure**: Fibers or feathers tied to mimic insects.

## Limits and risks

- **Snags**: Hooks catch on submerged wood or weeds.
- **Durability**: Wood swells if not sealed.
- **Target confusion**: Some fish ignore lures without scent.
