# Brief description

Bow drill fire is a friction method that uses a bow and string to spin a spindle rapidly against a hearth board, producing an ember with less effort than a hand drill.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Generate a reliable ember for fire starting.
- **Secondary uses:** Drill holes in wood when used without a notch.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

The bow converts back-and-forth arm motion into fast spindle rotation. Friction between spindle and hearth produces hot dust that ignites into an ember in the notch.

## How to create it

1. **Make a bow:** A curved stick with a tight cord of plant fibers or leather.
2. **Prepare the spindle:** Straight, dry, and smooth.
3. **Prepare the hearth:** Soft wood board with a socket and a V-notch.
4. **Add a bearing block:** A stone or hardwood cap to hold the spindle top.
5. **Drill:** Use steady strokes until smoke and a glowing ember appear.
6. **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Bow, cord, spindle, hearth board, tinder bundle.
- **Tools:** Knife or sharp stone, optional resin for grip.
- **Substitutes:** Hand drill if no cord is available.

## Variants and improvements

- **Greased bearing block:** Reduces friction at the top, increasing efficiency.
- **Longer bow:** Smoother, faster rotation.
- **Hardwood spindle + soft hearth:** Consistent ember production.

## Limits and risks

- **Cord wear:** Frays or stretches with use.
- **Moisture sensitivity:** Damp wood prevents ignition.
- **Smoke inhalation:** Prolonged drilling in closed spaces is harmful.
