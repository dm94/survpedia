# Brief description

A telescope is an optical instrument that makes distant objects appear magnified by using an arrangement of lenses or curved mirrors and lenses. It is essential for astronomy and long-distance observation (terrestrial or maritime).

## Use / Function

- **Astronomy:** Observing celestial bodies (moon, planets, stars).
- **Navigation:** Spotting land or ships at sea from a great distance.
- **Surveillance:** Observing distant locations or activities.

## Operating principle

It collects light from a distant object and focuses it to a point.

1.  **Objective (Lens or Mirror):** A large lens (refractor) or concave mirror (reflector) gathers a lot of light and focuses it to a small point inside the tube. The larger the objective, the brighter and clearer the image.
2.  **Eyepiece:** A small lens that magnifies the focused image for the eye.

## How to create it

**Refracting Telescope (Galilean/Keplerian):**

1.  **Objective Lens:** Create a large convex lens with a long focal length (e.g., 1 meter). This should be weak magnification but large diameter.
2.  **Eyepiece Lens:** Create a small convex lens (Keplerian) or concave lens (Galilean) with a short focal length.
3.  **Tube:** Mount the lenses in a tube. The distance between them should be the sum of their focal lengths (for Keplerian).
4.  **Focus:** Make one part of the tube slide inside the other to adjust the focus.

**Technical Level:** Advanced. The difficulty lies in grinding the large objective lens accurately.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** High-quality **[Lenses](/en/inventions/lens)**.
- **Tube:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, stiff cardboard, metal (**[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**).
- **Black Paint:** To coat the inside of the tube and prevent stray light reflections.

## Variants and improvements

- **Galilean:** Uses a concave eyepiece. Upright image but narrow field of view. Low magnification.
- **Keplerian:** Uses a convex eyepiece. Inverted image but wider field of view. High magnification.
- **Reflector (Newtonian):** Uses a concave mirror instead of a large lens. Easier to make large apertures and no chromatic aberration.

## Limits and risks

- **Atmospheric Turbulence:** Heat waves in the air distort the image (shimmering).
- **Light Pollution:** Artificial lights make it hard to see faint stars.
- **Sun Damage:** **NEVER** look at the sun through a telescope without a special solar filter. It will instantly blind you.
