# Brief description

A governor, or speed limiter, is a device used to measure and regulate the speed of a machine, such as an engine. A classic example is the centrifugal governor, also known as the Watt or fly-ball governor on a reciprocating steam engine, which uses the effect of centrifugal force on rotating weights driven by the machine output shaft to regulate its speed by altering the input flow of steam.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** To maintain a constant engine speed regardless of the load (e.g., in a generator or mill).
- **Secondary Uses:** To prevent an engine from overspeeding and destroying itself (safety).

## Operating principle

The governor senses the speed of the engine and adjusts the fuel or steam supply accordingly (negative feedback loop).
1.  **Centrifugal Force:** As the engine spins faster, weights on the governor spin faster and fly outward due to centrifugal force.
2.  **Mechanical Linkage:** The outward movement of the weights lifts a sleeve or lever.
3.  **Valve Control:** This lever is connected to the steam throttle valve or fuel injection pump.
4.  **Feedback:** If the engine speeds up, the valve closes slightly (reducing power). If it slows down (load increases), the valve opens (increasing power).

## How to create it

### Simple Fly-Ball Governor

1.  **Spindle:** A vertical shaft driven by the engine (via a belt or gears).
2.  **Arms:** Two or more arms pivoted at the top of the spindle.
3.  **Weights (Fly-balls):** Heavy metal balls (usually **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**) attached to the ends of the arms.
4.  **Sleeve:** A collar that slides up and down the spindle, connected to the arms by links.
5.  **Linkage:** A system of rods and levers connecting the sleeve to the engine's throttle valve.

## Materials needed

- **Weights:** Heavy metal (**[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**).
- **Spindle/Arms:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**.
- **Springs:** (Optional) To oppose the centrifugal force for better control.

## Variants and improvements

- **Watt Governor:** The original gravity-loaded type. Simple but has "droop" (speed decreases slightly as load increases).
- **Porter Governor:** Adds a central weight to increase sensitivity.
- **Spring-loaded Governor:** Uses a spring instead of gravity; works in any orientation and is faster acting.
- **Isochronous Governor:** Maintains exact speed regardless of load (no droop), but is harder to stabilize (hunting).

## Limits and risks

- **Hunting:** If the governor is too sensitive or has too much friction/lag, the engine speed will oscillate (surge up and down) indefinitely.
- **Deadband:** Friction can cause the governor to not respond to small speed changes.
- **Failure:** If the drive belt breaks, the governor stops spinning, the valve opens wide, and the engine runs away (destroys itself).
