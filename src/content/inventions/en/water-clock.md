# Brief description

A water clock, or clepsydra, is a timepiece that measures time by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out of (outflow type) a vessel.

## Use / Function

- **Timekeeping:** Measuring time independent of the sun (works at night and indoors).
- **Regulation:** Limiting the time for speeches in courts (historical use).
- **Scale:** Personal to Civic.

## Operating principle

It relies on the **predictable rate of flow** of water.
- **Outflow:** Water drips out of a container. As the level drops, the pressure decreases, slowing the flow (a problem to solve).
- **Inflow:** Water drips into a container with markings. If the source has a constant head (pressure), the filling rate is constant.

## How to create it

1.  **Reservoir:** Create a large container for water.
2.  **Orifice:** Drill a small, precise hole near the bottom.
3.  **Receiver:** Place a container below to catch the water.
4.  **Calibration:** Mark levels on the receiver corresponding to time intervals (using a sundial as reference during the day).
5.  **Constant Head (Improvement):** Use an overflow mechanism to keep the water pressure constant in the source container.

- **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Watertight containers (clay, stone, metal), water.
- **Tools:** Drill for the orifice.

## Variants and improvements

- **Simple Bowl:** A bowl with a hole that sinks in a larger tub in a set time.
- **Inflow Clepsydra:** Measures water filling up, often with a float to drive gears or indicators.
- **Mechanical Water Clock:** Water flow powers a mechanism (escapement) to move hands.

## Limits and risks

- **Temperature:** Viscosity of water changes with temperature, affecting flow rate. Freezing stops it.
- **Evaporation:** Loss of water over time.
- **Clogging:** Impurities in water can block the orifice.
