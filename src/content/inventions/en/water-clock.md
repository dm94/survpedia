# Brief description

Timekeeping device that measures time by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out of (outflow type) a vessel.

## Use / Function

- **Timekeeping:** Measuring time intervals, especially at night or when there is no sun.

## Operating principle

Water flows through a small orifice at a predictable rate. As the volume changes, the level indicates the passage of time.

## How to create it

1.  **Vessel:** Create a clay pot or stone container.
2.  **Orifice:** Drill a small, clean hole near the bottom.
3.  **Calibration:** Fill it. Mark the water level on the inside. Let it drain. Compare with a sundial or day cycle to mark the hours.

## Materials needed

- Vessel (Clay/Stone)
- Water

## Variants and improvements

- **Inflow Clepsydra:** Water drips *into* a marked container (more accurate as pressure is constant if the source is maintained).
