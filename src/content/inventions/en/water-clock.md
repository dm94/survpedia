# Brief description
A timekeeping device that measures time by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out of (outflow type) a vessel.

## Use / Function
- **Timekeeping**: Measuring time intervals, especially at night or when the sun is not visible.

## Operating principle
Water flows through a small hole at a predictable rate. As the volume changes, the level indicates the passing of time.

## How to create it
1.  **Vessel**: Create a clay pot or stone container.
2.  **Orifice**: Drill a small, clean hole near the bottom.
3.  **Calibration**: Fill it. Mark the water level on the inside. Let it drain. Compare with a sundial or day cycle to mark hours.

## Materials needed
-   Container (Clay/Stone)
-   Water

## Variants and improvements
-   **Inflow Clepsydra**: Water drips *into* a container with markings (more accurate as pressure is constant if source is maintained).
