# Brief description

A waterproof receptacle for holding liquids, usually water. Cisterns are often built to catch and store rainwater.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Storing rainwater for household use (drinking, washing).
- **Secondary uses:** Emergency water storage, fire fighting reserve.
- **Scale:** Household (tank) to castle/fortress (underground vault).

## Operating principle

- **Catchment:** Rain falls on a roof or catchment area.
- **Conveyance:** Gutters and downspouts direct water to the cistern.
- **Filtration:** A "first flush" diverter or filter removes debris before entering the tank.
- **Storage:** The tank holds water in a dark, cool environment to prevent algae growth.

## How to create it

1.  **Excavation:** Dig a hole for underground cisterns (keeps water cool).
2.  **Lining:** Build walls with **[brick](/en/materials/brick)**, **[stone](/en/materials/stone)**, or **[concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**.
3.  **Waterproofing:** Apply a layer of waterproof **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** (cement + sand + waterproofing agent) or a plastic liner.
4.  **Covering:** Seal the top to prevent evaporation, mosquito breeding, and contamination.
5.  **Access:** Install a hatch for cleaning and a pump/bucket system for extraction.

## Materials needed

- **Structure:** **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** (ferrocement is excellent), **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** (modern tanks).
- **Waterproofing:** Hydraulic **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**, **[bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen)** (outside only), or liners.
- **Plumbing:** **[Gutters](/en/inventions/gutter)** and pipes.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ferrocement Tank:** Thin shell of mortar reinforced with chicken wire. Very strong and cheap.
- **Rain Barrel:** Simple collection from a downspout into a barrel.
- **Impluvium:** Roman style pool in a courtyard to catch rain.

## Limits and risks

- **Contamination:** Bird droppings on the roof can pollute water. First-flush diverters are essential.
- **Mosquitoes:** Standing water breeds disease vectors if not sealed.
- **Algae:** Sunlight promotes algae; cisterns must be opaque/covered.
- **Cracking:** Leaks can drain the entire supply and undermine foundations.
