# Brief description

A **Wall** is a continuous vertical structure that divides or encloses an area. It provides shelter, security, and structural support for the roof and floors above.

## Use / Function

- **Structural Support:** Bears the load of the roof and upper floors (load-bearing walls).
- **Enclosure:** Defines the interior space and separates it from the outside environment.
- **Protection:** Shields inhabitants from weather, animals, and intruders.
- **Privacy:** Blocks sight and sound between rooms or properties.

## Operating principle

Walls work by **compression** and **mass**.

- **Compression:** The weight of the wall and the load it carries pushes down on the foundation. The material must be strong enough to resist crushing.
- **Stability:** The wall must be thick enough or braced to prevent it from toppling over (lateral stability).
- **Insulation:** The mass of the wall (or added insulation) slows the transfer of heat and sound.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundation:** Prepare a stable base (**[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation)**) to support the wall's weight.
2.  **Layout:** Mark the wall line on the foundation.
3.  **Construction (Masonry):**
    - **First Course:** Lay the first layer of bricks/stones in a bed of **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**.
    - **Stacking:** Lay subsequent courses, staggering the joints (running bond) to distribute loads and tie the wall together.
    - **Plumb/Level:** Check constantly that the wall is vertical (plumb) and horizontal (level).
4.  **Construction (Frame):**
    - **Studs:** Erect vertical wooden or steel studs on a sill plate.
    - **Sheathing:** Attach boards or panels to stiffen the frame.
    - **Cladding:** Add siding, stucco, or brick veneer for weather protection.
5.  **Openings:** Install lintels or headers over doors and windows to divert the load around the opening.

## Materials needed

- **Masonry Units:** **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Adobe](/en/materials/adobe)**, **[Concrete Block](/en/materials/concrete-block)**.
- **Binder:** **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**, **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**, **[Mud](/en/materials/clay)**.
- **Framing:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
- **Tools:** **[Trowel](/en/inventions/trowel)**, **[Level](/en/inventions/level)**, **[Plumb Bob](/en/inventions/plumb-bob)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Load-Bearing Wall:** Supports vertical loads.
- **Curtain Wall:** Non-structural outer covering (common in skyscrapers).
- **Partition Wall:** Internal wall to divide rooms (non-load-bearing).
- **Retaining Wall:** Holds back soil or water.
- **Cavity Wall:** Two parallel walls with a gap for insulation and moisture control.

## Limits and risks

- **Buckling:** Tall, thin walls can buckle under load.
- **Moisture:** Water penetration can damage the material (especially adobe/wood) and cause mold.
- **Cracking:** Settlement of the foundation causes cracks in rigid masonry walls.
- **Thermal Mass:** Thick stone/brick walls store heat/cold, which can be good or bad depending on the climate.
