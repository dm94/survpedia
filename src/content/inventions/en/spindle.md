# Brief description

A straight spike usually made of wood used for spinning, twisting fibers such as wool, flax, hemp, or cotton into yarn. It often includes a weight (whorl) to help maintain the spin.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Spinning loose fibers into strong, continuous yarn or thread.
- **Secondary uses**: Plying multiple strands of yarn together.
- **Scale**: Individual/Domestic.

## Operating Principle

The spindle relies on **angular momentum**.

1. **Twist**: The spindle is spun (twirled) by hand or against the thigh.
2. **Inertia**: The weight (whorl) keeps the spindle rotating.
3. **Transfer**: As it rotates, the twist travels up the fibers, locking them together.
4. **Storage**: Once a length is spun, it is wound onto the spindle shaft.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Drop Spindle)

1. **Shaft**: A straight stick (approx. 20-30 cm).
2. **Whorl**: A disc-shaped weight (clay, stone, wood, or even a potato) with a hole in the center.
3. **Assembly**: Fit the whorl onto the shaft (near the bottom or top).
4. **Hook/Notch**: A notch or hook at the top to secure the thread while spinning.

### Technical level

Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - Wood (for the shaft).
  - Weight material (clay, stone, wood, bone) for the whorl.
- **Tools**:
  - Knife (to carve the shaft).
  - Drill or sharp stone (to make the hole in the whorl).

## Variants and improvements

- **Drop Spindle**: Suspended in the air while spinning; good for strong fibers.
- **Supported Spindle**: The tip rests in a bowl; good for short or delicate fibers (like cotton).
- **Spinning Wheel**: Mechanized version that rotates the spindle via a wheel and belt (faster).

## Limits and risks

- **Speed**: Slower than a spinning wheel.
- **Capacity**: Can only hold a limited amount of yarn before it needs to be wound off.
- **Learning curve**: Requires practice to maintain an even spin and consistent yarn thickness.
