# Brief description

A manual mill, specifically a hand mill or quern, is a simple tool used for grinding grain into flour by hand. It was a staple of domestic life for millennia before the advent of large-scale industrial milling.

## Use / Function

- **Flour production:** Grinding wheat, barley, corn, or other grains.
- **Spice grinding:** Pulverizing seeds and dried herbs for **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)**.
- **Small-scale processing:** Ideal for individual households or small groups.

## Operating principle

The hand mill works through friction and pressure between two abrasive surfaces:

1. **Saddle Quern:** A flat or concave stone (the bedstone) and a smaller handheld stone (the rubber or muller) that is pushed back and forth.
2. **Rotary Quern:** Two circular stones; the top stone (runner) is rotated by a handle over a stationary bottom stone (bedstone). Grain is fed through a hole in the center of the top stone.

## How to create it

To make a simple rotary hand mill:

1. **Stone Selection:** Find two thick, flat stones of hard, abrasive rock (like basalt or granite).
2. **Shaping:** Carve both stones into circular shapes.
3. **Drilling:** Drill a central hole in the top stone for the grain feed and a smaller off-center hole for the handle.
4. **Assembly:** Place the top stone on a central spindle (wooden or metal) fixed to the bottom stone to keep them aligned.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Hard, non-crumbly stone.
- **Tools:** Stone chisels or harder stones for carving.
- **Handle:** A sturdy wooden stick.

## Variants and improvements

- **Saddle Quern:** The most primitive form, using back-and-forth motion.
- **Rotary Quern:** A major improvement using circular motion, which is more efficient.
- **Adjustable Gap:** Adding a mechanism to raise or lower the top stone to control the fineness of the flour.

## Limits and risks

- **Physical Labor:** Requires significant physical effort and time to produce even small amounts of flour.
- **Stone Dust:** Tiny fragments of the millstone can end up in the flour, which can wear down teeth over time.
- **Maintenance:** The grinding surfaces must be periodically roughened (dressed) with a chisel to remain effective.
