# Brief description

A device constructed to furnish a strong blast of air. It is the lungs of the forge, essential for reaching temperatures high enough to work or melt metal.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is **air supply**.

- **Combustion Boost**: Delivers a concentrated stream of oxygen to the fuel (charcoal/coal), drastically increasing the burn rate and temperature.
- **Ventilation**: Can be used to clear smoke or fumes from mine shafts (historically).

## Operating principle

The bellows relies on **volume displacement** and **valves**.

- **Intake**: When the handles are pulled apart, the internal volume increases, creating low pressure. Air rushes in through a one-way flap valve.
- **Exhaust**: When the handles are pushed together, the volume decreases, creating high pressure. The intake valve closes, and air is forced out through the nozzle (tuyere).

## How to create it

### Simple Bag Bellows (Primitive)

1.  **Bag**: Use a whole animal skin (goat/sheep) or sew a leather bag.
2.  **Nozzle**: Attach a pipe (wood/bamboo/clay) to one leg or a specific opening.
3.  **Operation**: Lift the bag to fill with air (open top), then close and press down to expel air.

### Double-Lung Bellows (Standard Blacksmith)

1.  **Boards**: Cut two tear-drop shaped wooden boards.
2.  **Leather**: Nail flexible leather around the edges to connect the boards, creating an accordion-like chamber.
3.  **Valve**: Cut a hole in the bottom board and cover it with a leather flap on the *inside*. This allows air in but not out.
4.  **Nozzle**: Attach a pipe to the narrow end.

### Box Bellows (Piston)

1.  **Box**: Build a rectangular wooden box.
2.  **Piston**: Create a tight-fitting plunger wrapped in fur or feathers (to seal against the walls).
3.  **Valves**: Use flap valves to direct airflow.
4.  **Efficiency**: Often double-acting (pumps air on both push and pull strokes), providing a constant blast.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **Chamber**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**.
  - **Nozzle**: Metal pipe or fire-hardened clay to resist the heat near the fire.
  - **Seal**: Fat/Grease to keep leather flexible and airtight.

## Variants and improvements

- **Great Bellows**: Massive, lever-operated bellows powered by a water wheel for blast furnaces.
- **Rotary Blower**: A mechanical fan (modern) that provides a steady stream of air with a hand crank.

## Limits and risks

- **Backfire**: If the handle is released suddenly or the valve fails, hot gas/flame can be sucked back into the bellows, causing an explosion or fire.
- **Maintenance**: Leather must be kept oiled to prevent cracking.
- **Fatigue**: Operating bellows by hand for hours is exhausting work (often the job of an apprentice).
