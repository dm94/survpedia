# Brief description

A lathe is a machine tool that rotates a workpiece about an axis of rotation to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, deformation, facing, and turning, with tools that are applied to the workpiece to create an object with symmetry about that axis. It is known as the "Mother of Machine Tools" because it was the first machine tool that led to the invention of other machine tools.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** Turning cylindrical parts (shafts, pins, pulleys).
- **Secondary Uses:** Thread cutting (screws), facing (flat ends), drilling (center holes), knurling (grips).
- **Scale:** Industrial/Workshop.

## Operating principle

The workpiece is held in a chuck or collet (on the headstock) and rotated at high speed. A **[Lathe Tool](/en/inventions/lathe-tool)**, mounted on a carriage that moves along the bed (Z-axis) and cross-slide (X-axis), is fed into the rotating workpiece to remove material in the form of continuous chips.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Metal Lathe)

1.  **Bed:** Two parallel, precision-ground rails (ways) made of cast iron or heavy steel.
2.  **Headstock:** Contains the main spindle and drive mechanism (pulleys/gears). It must be perfectly aligned with the bed.
3.  **Tailstock:** Slides along the bed to support long workpieces or hold drill bits.
4.  **Carriage:** Moves along the bed and holds the tool post.
5.  **Lead Screw:** A long precision screw that drives the carriage for automatic feed and thread cutting.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Cast Iron:** For the bed, headstock, and carriage (vibration damping is critical).
  - **Hardened Steel:** For the spindle, ways, and lead screw. Cutting tools (**[Lathe Tools](/en/inventions/lathe-tool)**) are often made of **[High Speed Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Carbide](/en/materials/tungsten)**.
  - **Bronze:** For bearings and the lead screw nut.
- **Tools:** **[Scraper](/en/inventions/scraper)** (for hand-scraping ways to precision), **[Drill Press](/en/inventions/drill-press)**, **[Files](/en/inventions/file)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **[Manual Lathe](/en/inventions/manual-lathe):** Woodworking or simple metal spinning lathe without a carriage.
- **Engine Lathe:** The standard metalworking lathe with a lead screw for threading.
- **Turret Lathe:** Has a rotating turret with multiple tools for mass production.
- **CNC Lathe:** Computer-controlled for complex profiles and high precision.

## Limits and risks

- **Safety:** Rotating chucks are extremely dangerous. Never wear gloves or loose clothing. Long hair must be tied back. Chuck keys must never be left in the chuck.
- **Chatter:** Vibration caused by lack of rigidity or incorrect tool height.
- **Accuracy:** Depends entirely on the straightness of the bed and the quality of the spindle bearings.
