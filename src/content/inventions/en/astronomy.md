# Brief description

Astronomy is the study of celestial bodies (stars, planets, comets) and the universe as a whole. Before telescopes, it was the practice of observing and predicting the motions of objects in the sky visible to the naked eye. It is the basis for timekeeping and navigation.

## Use / Function

-   **Timekeeping:** Defining days, months, and years (Calendars).
-   **Navigation:** Determining latitude and direction (North Star) for travel across oceans or deserts.
-   **Agriculture:** Predicting seasonal changes (Solstices/Equinoxes) for planting.
-   **Mythology/Religion:** Many cultures viewed celestial events as divine messages.

## Operating principle

The core principle is that **celestial motion is periodic and predictable**.
-   **Diurnal Motion:** The stars rotate around the celestial pole once a day (due to Earth's rotation).
-   **Annual Motion:** The Sun moves along the ecliptic through the zodiac constellations once a year (due to Earth's orbit).
-   **Planetary Motion:** Planets ("wanderers") move against the background of fixed stars.

## How to create it

1.  **Fixed Observation Point:** Establish a permanent location for viewing the sky.
2.  **Horizon Markers:** Place stones or posts on the horizon to mark where the sun rises/sets at the solstices (longest/shortest days) and equinoxes.
3.  **Measurement Tools:**
    -   **Gnomon:** A vertical stick to measure the sun's shadow (altitude).
    -   **Quadrant/Sextant:** To measure the angle between a star and the horizon.
4.  **Recording:** Create star charts and tables of planetary positions (Ephemerides).

## Materials needed

-   **Sighting Tools:**
    -   **Stone/Wood:** For alignment markers.
    -   **Cross-staff:** Simple wooden tool for measuring angles.
-   **Recording:**
    -   **Papyrus/Paper:** For star maps.
-   **Advanced:**
    -   **Glass:** For lenses (telescopes) - a much later invention.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Naked Eye Astronomy:** The standard for millennia (Mayan, Egyptian, Babylonian).
-   **Astrolabe:** A complex handheld model of the universe used for calculation and observation.
-   **Telescopic Astronomy:** Using lenses/mirrors to see fainter objects (Galileo).

## Limits and risks

-   **Weather:** Clouds obscure the sky, making observation impossible.
-   **Light Pollution:** (Modern problem) Artificial light hides the stars.
-   **Complexity:** Planetary motion (like retrograde motion) is difficult to model without advanced math (Calculus/Gravity).
