# Brief description

A road construction method using single-sized crushed stone layers, compacted to form a hard, durable surface without liquid binders.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Creating durable, all-weather roads for [carts](/en/inventions/cart) and carriages.
- **Secondary uses:** Base layer for modern asphalt roads.

## Operating principle

- **Interlocking:** Sharp, angular stones lock together under pressure.
- **Drainage:** The porous structure and camber allow water to drain away, preventing mud.
- **Self-cementing:** Dust from the stones (fines) fills gaps and binds the surface when wet and rolled.

## How to create it

1.  **Preparation:** Excavate and level the subsoil. Ensure good drainage.
2.  **Base Layer:** Lay large stones (hand-placed) or coarse crushed stone (modern macadam).
3.  **Middle Layer:** Layer of smaller angular stones (approx. 2-3 inches), compacted.
4.  **Surface Layer:** Layer of small stones (approx. 1 inch), compacted.
5.  **Binding:** Spread stone dust (fines) and water, then roll heavily to create a cemented surface.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** [Stone](/en/materials/stone) (crushed into specific sizes), [Gravel](/en/materials/gravel).
- **Tools:** [Hammers](/en/inventions/hammer) (for breaking stone), [shovels](/en/inventions/shovel), heavy roller (horse-drawn or mechanical).

## Variants and improvements

- **Water-bound Macadam:** The traditional method using stone dust and water.
- **Tar-bound Macadam (Tarmac):** Coating stones with [tar](/en/materials/tar) before laying to waterproof and bind them.
- **Bitumen Macadam:** Using [bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen) ([asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt)).

## Limits and risks

- **Dust:** Creates dust in dry weather.
- **Erosion:** Heavy rain or fast traffic can strip the surface.
- **Suction:** Early pneumatic [tires](/en/inventions/wheel) sucked out the binding dust, destroying the road (led to Tarmac).
