# Brief description

An X-ray cooling system removes heat from the tube target and housing so the tube can run safely and repeatedly without damage or drift.

## Use / Function

- **Heat removal:** Carries away heat from the anode and tube housing.
- **Stability:** Keeps focal spot and output stable during long exposures.
- **Protection:** Prevents damage to the target, seals, and insulation.
- **Duty cycle control:** Extends how often the system can be used.

## Operating principle

1. **Heat capture:** Thermal contact draws heat from the tube assembly into a coolant path.
2. **Transport:** Circulating coolant carries heat away from the tube.
3. **Rejection:** A radiator or heat exchanger releases heat to air or water.
4. **Control:** Flow rate and temperature monitoring keep the system within limits.

## How to create it

1. **Design the loop:** Decide on water or sealed liquid cooling for the tube housing.
2. **Build heat contact:** Attach a metal jacket or channel around the tube mount for heat transfer.
3. **Add circulation:** Install a pump and plumbing for continuous flow.
4. **Reject heat:** Use a radiator, fins, or heat exchanger sized to the tube power.
5. **Add safety:** Include temperature limits, pressure relief, and leak checks.

Minimum functional version: a simple water jacket with gravity or pump circulation and a basic heat sink. Technical level is intermediate to advanced due to sealing, heat transfer, and safety needs.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Water](/en/materials/water)** as coolant, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** for heat transfer paths, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for structure and housing.
- **Tools:** Pump, tubing, seals, and temperature measurement.

## Variants and improvements

- **Oil cooling:** Better electrical insulation for high voltage.
- **Closed-loop chillers:** Precise temperature control and stable output.
- **Microchannel jackets:** Higher heat transfer in compact space.
- **Air-assisted radiators:** Better heat rejection with low pump load.

## Limits and risks

- **Leaks:** Can damage insulation or cause electrical hazards.
- **Overheating:** Inadequate flow or radiator size leads to tube failure.
- **Contamination:** Particles or algae reduce flow and heat transfer.
- **Pressure spikes:** Blockages can rupture hoses or seals.
