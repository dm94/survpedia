# Brief description

Essential field care for fractures, burns, and open wounds focused on preventing infection, limiting tissue damage, and stabilizing injuries until healing or evacuation is possible.

## Use / Function

- **Fractures**: Immobilize the injured area to reduce pain and prevent further damage.
- **Burns**: Stop the heat source and cool the tissue to limit depth of injury.
- **Open wounds**: Clean, cover, and control bleeding to prevent infection.
- **Scale**: Individual to small-group first aid.

## Operating principle

- **Stabilization**: Immobilization reduces mechanical stress and pain.
- **Cooling**: Lowering temperature limits burn progression.
- **Barrier**: Clean coverings prevent contamination and keep tissue moist.
- **Hemostasis**: Direct pressure limits blood loss and supports clotting.

## How to create it

1. **Assessment**: Check airway, breathing, and circulation, then identify bleeding, burns, or deformity.
2. **Fracture care**: Immobilize the joint above and below using padded **[splints](/en/inventions/ferula)** made from **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** and **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**. Check circulation after tying.
3. **Burn care**: Cool with clean **[Water](/en/materials/water)** for several minutes, then cover with clean **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)** or **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**.
4. **Wound care**: Rinse with clean water, wash surrounding skin with **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, then apply a clean dressing. Use **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** for tools and hands, not directly in deep wounds.
5. **Closure (only if trained)**: Use **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)** and **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)** for clean, straight wounds, or use strips of fabric for pressure bandages.
6. **Follow-up**: Recheck swelling, color, and sensation; change dressings regularly; monitor for infection.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Clean **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)** or **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, and **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for splints.
- **Tools**: Cutting tool, clean containers, and basic first-aid knowledge. **[Basic Surgery (instruments)](/en/inventions/basic-surgery-instruments)** improves safety when available.
- **Possible substitutes**: **[Healing Herbs](/en/materials/healing-herbs)** for mild antiseptic washes, **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** or **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** for protective salves.

## Variants and improvements

- **Primitive**: Cloth strips, bark splints, cold water, and pressure-only dressings.
- **Intermediate**: Sterilized dressings, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** for disinfection, and structured splints.
- **Advanced**: **[Simple Medicines](/en/inventions/simple-medicines)** for stable antiseptics and analgesics, and controlled-sterility work areas.

## Limits and risks

- **Infection**: The main risk for wounds and burns without clean handling.
- **Circulation loss**: Splints or bandages that are too tight can cause tissue damage.
- **Hidden injury**: Deep burns or fractures may look minor but worsen over time.
- **Skill limits**: Improper closure, debridement, or alignment can cause permanent harm.
