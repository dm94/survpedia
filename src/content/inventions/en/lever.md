# Brief description

A lever is a simple machine consisting of a beam or rigid rod pivoted at a fixed hinge, or fulcrum. It is used to multiply the force applied to an object.

## Use / Function

- **Lifting:** Moving heavy loads with less effort.
- **Amplification:** Increasing the range of motion or speed.
- **Precision:** Fine-tuned movement in mechanical devices.
- **Scale:** Domestic to heavy construction.

## Operating principle

The lever works on the principle of moments. By placing the fulcrum closer to the load than to the point where force is applied, a small force applied over a longer distance can lift a heavy weight over a shorter distance.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection:** Find a long, rigid object (beam) that won't bend under pressure.
2.  **Fulcrum:** Select a stable point or object (like a rock) to serve as the pivot.
3.  **Setup:** Place the beam on the fulcrum.
4.  **Application:** Place the load on one end and apply force on the other.

## Materials needed

- **Beam:** A strong wooden pole, metal bar, or sturdy branch.
- **Fulcrum:** A stone, a log, or a purpose-built hinge.
- **Support:** A stable surface to rest the fulcrum on.

## Variants and improvements

- **First-class lever:** Fulcrum between force and load (e.g., see-saw, crowbar).
- **Second-class lever:** Load between fulcrum and force (e.g., wheelbarrow).
- **Third-class lever:** Force between fulcrum and load (e.g., tweezers, human arm).
- **Compound levers:** Systems of multiple levers to further increase mechanical advantage.

## Limits and risks

- **Structural Failure:** The beam can snap if the load is too heavy.
- **Stability:** If the fulcrum slips, the load may fall suddenly.
- **Range:** Limited by the length of the beam and the space available for movement.
