# Brief description

Hand tools used to hold objects firmly, typically developed from tongs used to handle hot metal in Bronze Age Europe. They consist of two levers joined at a fulcrum.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Gripping, bending, and compressing materials.
- **Secondary uses**: Cutting wire (if equipped with cutters), holding hot objects.
- **Scale**: Manual, individual use.

## Operating principle

Pliers work on the principle of a first-class lever. The fulcrum is positioned between the effort (hand) and the load (jaws).
- **Mechanical Advantage**: The longer handles relative to the short jaws provide a mechanical advantage, allowing the user to apply a strong gripping force with moderate hand pressure.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Forging**: Create two identical metal pieces, each with a handle side, a jaw side, and a hole for the pivot.
2.  **Assembly**: Align the pivot holes and insert a rivet or bolt.
3.  **Finishing**: Ensure the jaws meet flush when closed.

### Technical level
- **Intermediate**: Requires blacksmithing skills to forge the shapes and align the pivot correctly.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Steel**: Hardened steel is best for the jaws to prevent deformation; tougher steel for the handles.
    - **Rivet**: A steel pin to act as the fulcrum.
- **Tools**:
    - **Forge, Anvil, Hammer**: For shaping.
    - **Drill/Punch**: For the pivot hole.

## Variants and improvements

- **Slip-joint pliers**: Allow the pivot to move, adjusting the jaw size range.
- **Locking pliers (Mole grips)**: Lock in place for hands-free operation.
- **Needle-nose pliers**: Long, thin jaws for reaching into tight spaces.
- **Wire cutters**: Integrated cutting edges near the pivot.

## Limits and risks

- **Grip strength**: Limited by the user's hand strength unless locking mechanism is used.
- **Surface damage**: Serrated jaws can mar soft materials; use smooth jaws or padding for delicate work.
- **Insulation**: Metal handles conduct electricity/heat; rubber or plastic coatings are needed for electrical work.
