# Brief description

An inclined plane is a flat supporting surface tilted at an angle, with one end higher than the other, used as an aid for raising or lowering a load. It is one of the six classical simple machines.

## Use / Function

- **Lifting:** Moving heavy loads vertically with less force by pushing them up a slope.
- **Loading:** Ramps for loading cargo onto wagons or ships.
- **Accessibility:** Paths for wheeled vehicles or people with mobility aids.

## Operating principle

The inclined plane allows a load to be lifted by applying a force over a longer distance (the length of the slope) rather than lifting it directly vertical. The mechanical advantage is equal to the length of the slope divided by the height.

## How to create it

1.  **Survey:** Determine the start and end points of the slope.
2.  **Base:** Build up earth or stack stones to create the desired gradient.
3.  **Surface:** Smooth the surface with planks, paved stones, or packed earth to reduce friction.
4.  **Support:** Ensure the sides are stable and won't collapse under load.

## Materials needed

- **Earth:** Most common for large ramps.
- **Wood:** For temporary or movable ramps (planks).
- **Stone:** For permanent structures.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ramp:** A simple slope.
- **Wedge:** A portable double inclined plane.
- **Screw:** An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction:** A rough surface increases the force needed.
- **Length:** A gentler slope requires a much longer ramp.
- **Stability:** Steep earthen ramps can slide or erode.
