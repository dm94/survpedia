# Brief description

Simple housing is a small, semi-permanent dwelling built with locally available materials. It improves on basic shelter by adding stronger walls, a stable roof, and better control of heat, moisture, and storage.

## Use / Function

- **Protection:** Shields people and supplies from wind, rain, and sun.
- **Thermal stability:** Keeps interiors warmer at night and cooler during the day.
- **Storage:** Provides dry, enclosed space for food and tools.
- **Living space:** Enables cooking, sleeping, and daily activities in a safer place.
- **Scale:** Family or small group.

## Operating principle

Simple housing works by combining a **load-bearing structure** with an **envelope** that blocks water and wind.

1. **Frame:** Posts and beams carry the roof load.
2. **Walls:** Packed earth, stacked **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, or wattle-and-daub made with **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** reduce drafts.
3. **Roofing:** A sloped roof sheds rain and directs water away from the base.
4. **Drainage:** A dry base of **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel)** and **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** limits moisture rise.
5. **Sealing:** **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)** and clay plasters close gaps and reduce pests.

## How to create it

1. **Choose the site:** Slightly elevated ground, away from flood paths and falling branches.
2. **Prepare the base:** Level the ground, add a compacted layer of gravel and sand for drainage.
3. **Build the frame:** Use straight **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** posts with crossbeams tied using **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**.
4. **Raise walls:** Use stacked stone, adobe blocks (clay + sand), or wattle-and-daub panels.
5. **Add the roof:** Sloped rafters with a covering of thatch, bark, or overlapping boards.
6. **Seal and finish:** Apply clay or lime plaster, add a doorway, and create a smoke vent.
7. **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Wood, stone, clay, sand, gravel, plant fibers, water.
- **Tools:** Digging tools, cutting tools, mallets, measuring cord.
- **Substitutes:** Earthbags, sod, snow blocks, or bamboo depending on climate.

## Variants and improvements

- **Adobe house:** Clay + sand blocks for dry climates.
- **Stone hut:** High durability where stone is abundant.
- **Raised floor:** Keeps out moisture and insects in wet areas.
- **Improved roof:** Clay tiles or shingles for longer lifespan.

## Limits and risks

- **Fire risk:** Thatch and wood burn quickly if unmanaged.
- **Moisture damage:** Poor drainage leads to rot and wall collapse.
- **Smoke accumulation:** Without a vent, indoor fires cause harmful fumes.
- **Structural failure:** Weak joints or heavy rain can destabilize walls.
