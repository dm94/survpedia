# Brief description

A latrine is a basic sanitation facility intended for the safe disposal of human excreta. It is fundamental to prevent water contamination and the spread of disease in any settlement, temporary or permanent.

## Use / Function

- **Pathogen containment**: Prevents fecal bacteria and parasites from reaching water or food sources.
- **Community hygiene**: Centralizes waste in a controlled place.
- **Vector control**: If covered well, prevents flies and insects from spreading diseases from feces.

## Operating principle

It is based on isolation and natural decomposition. By burying waste, direct contact is avoided. Over time, soil microorganisms decompose the organic matter.

## How to create it

1.  **Location**:
    - At least 30-50 meters away from any water source.
    - Downhill from wells or springs.
    - Stable and absorbent soil (not pure rock or swamp).
2.  **Excavation**: Dig a deep (minimum 1-1.5 meters) and narrow hole.
3.  **Platform**: Build a solid base over the hole with wood or stone, leaving a safe opening.
4.  **Structure/Privacy**: Surround with walls of branches, cloth, or wood.
5.  **Maintenance**: Cover waste with soil or ash after each use to reduce odors and flies.

### Required technological level
Basic. Only requires digging tools.

## Materials needed

- **Digging tools**: Shovel, pickaxe, digging stick.
- **Platform**: Sturdy logs, stone slabs.
- **Cover**: Excavated soil or ash.

## Variants and improvements

- **Cat hole**: Small single-use hole for individuals on the move.
- **Trench latrine**: For large groups in a short time.
- **Composting latrine**: Separates urine and feces to produce compost (requires more management).

## Limits and risks

- **Filling**: Once full (up to 30-50 cm from the edge), it must be completely covered and marked, and a new one dug.
- **Collapse**: If the soil is sandy, the hole walls can collapse (requires reinforcement).
- **Flooding**: If flooded by rain, it can contaminate the entire environment. Must be protected from surface runoff.
