# Brief description

Measuring tools are instruments designed to quantify physical magnitudes such as length, mass, time, temperature, and angles. They are the foundation of engineering, trade, navigation, and science, allowing for standardization and reproducibility in construction and exchange.

## Use / Function

- **Construction:** Ensuring structures are straight, level, and of correct dimensions (ruler, plumb bob, level).
- **Trade:** Quantifying goods for fair exchange (balance scale).
- **Navigation:** Determining position and direction (compass, sextant, chronometer).
- **Timekeeping:** Organizing daily activities and agriculture (sundial, calendar).
- **Science:** Observing and recording natural phenomena (thermometer, barometer).
- **Scale:** Individual to Industrial.

## Operating principle

All measuring tools work on the principle of **comparison against a standard**.

- **Direct comparison:** Placing the object next to the standard (e.g., a ruler against a board).
- **Indirect comparison:** Using a mechanism to translate the property into a readable value (e.g., a spring scale or thermometer).

## How to create it

Creation varies by tool, but generally involves:

1.  **Establishing a Standard:** Defining a unit (e.g., the length of a king's foot, a specific stone's weight).
2.  **Replication:** Creating tools that match this standard.
3.  **Calibration:** Checking the tool against the standard to ensure accuracy.

- **Technical level:** Basic (ruler, plumb bob) to Advanced (micrometer, chronometer).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Stable materials that do not warp or change easily with temperature or humidity (hardwood, metal, stone).
- **Tools:** Carving tools, scribes for marking.
- **Substitutes:** Body parts (hand span, foot) for rough estimates.

## Variants and improvements

- **Linear:** Ruler, Tape measure, Calipers, Micrometer.
- **Angular:** Protractor, Sextant, Theodolite.
- **Mass/Weight:** Balance scale, Spring scale.
- **Leveling:** Plumb bob, Spirit level, Water level.
- **Time:** Sundial, Water clock, Pendulum clock.
- **Environmental:** Thermometer, Barometer.

## Limits and risks

- **Calibration Drift:** Tools can lose accuracy over time due to wear or environmental changes.
- **Parallax Error:** Incorrect viewing angle can lead to reading errors.
- **Temperature Expansion:** Materials expand/contract with heat, affecting precision instruments.
