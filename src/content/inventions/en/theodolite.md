# Brief description

Precision measurement instrument used in surveying and engineering to measure angles in horizontal and vertical planes. It is essential for triangulation and precise mapping.

## Use / Function

- **Surveying:** Mapping terrain, determining property boundaries.
- **Construction:** Aligning roads, tunnels, and building foundations.
- **Geodesy:** Measuring the Earth's curvature through large networks of triangles.

## Operating principle

Combines a telescope with two graduated circles (one horizontal and one vertical).
1.  The operator points the telescope at point A and reads the angle.
2.  Then points to point B and reads the new angle.
3.  The difference is the angle between the two points.
The telescope can rotate freely on both axes.

## How to create it

1.  **Base:** A stable tripod with leveling screws.
2.  **Mount:** A vertical axis allowing horizontal rotation (azimuth).
3.  **Telescope:** Mounted on a horizontal axis (elevation).
4.  **Graduated Circles:** Metal or glass plates with very fine degree markings.
5.  **Spirit Levels:** To ensure the instrument is perfectly horizontal.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Brass or Aluminum (non-magnetic to not affect nearby compasses), Optical glass (lenses).
- **Tools:** Precision lathe, dividing engine to graduate circles.

## Variants and improvements

- **Total Station:** Modern electronic version including a laser distance meter and computer.
- **Transit:** Robust American version where the telescope can be inverted completely.

## Limits and risks

- **Fragility:** Lenses and axes are delicate; a knock can misalign it.
- **Requires Tripod:** Needs a firm and stable base.
- **Atmosphere:** Heat haze/refraction can distort vision over long distances.
