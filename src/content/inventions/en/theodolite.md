# Brief description

Precision measuring instrument used in surveying and engineering to measure angles in horizontal and vertical planes. Essential for triangulation and precise mapping.

## Use / Function

- **Surveying:** Land mapping, property boundary determination.
- **Construction:** Aligning roads, tunnels, and building foundations.
- **Geodesy:** Measuring Earth's curvature via large triangle networks.

## Operating principle

Combines a telescope with two graduated circles (one horizontal and one vertical).

1. Operator aims telescope at point A and reads angle.
2. Then aims at point B and reads new angle.
3. Difference is the angle between the two points.
Telescope can rotate freely on both axes.

## How to create it

1. **Base:** Stable tripod with leveling screws.
2. **Mount:** Vertical axis allowing horizontal rotation (azimuth).
3. **Telescope:** Mounted on horizontal axis (elevation).
4. **Graduated Circles:** Metal or glass plates with very fine degree marks.
5. **Spirit Levels:** To ensure instrument is perfectly horizontal.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Brass or Aluminum (non-magnetic to not affect nearby compasses), Optical glass (lenses).
- **Tools:** Precision lathe, dividing engine to graduate circles.

## Variants and improvements

- **Total Station:** Modern electronic version including laser distance meter and computer.
- **Transit:** Robust American version where telescope can be fully inverted.

## Limits and risks

- **Fragility:** Lenses and axes are delicate; a knock can misalign it.
- **Requires Tripod:** Needs firm, stable base.
- **Atmosphere:** Heat haze can distort vision over long distances.
