# Brief description

Fire is a rapid oxidation chemical reaction that releases heat and light. It is one of humanity's most fundamental discoveries, allowing control over the environment.

## Use / Function

- **Cooking:** Makes food more digestible and eliminates pathogens.
- **Heating:** Allows survival in cold climates.
- **Protection:** Keeps predators away.
- **Lighting:** Extends hours of activity after sunset.
- **Materials processing:** Hardening wood, smelting metals, or firing pottery.

## Operating principle

It is based on the Fire Triangle, which requires three components:
1. **Fuel:** Material that burns (wood, charcoal).
2. **Oxidant:** Usually oxygen from the air.
3. **Activation energy:** Initial heat to start the reaction.

## How to create it

- **Friction:** Rubbing two pieces of wood (hand or bow drill) until an ember is generated.
- **Percussion:** Striking a flint stone against a pyrite or steel to generate sparks.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Dry wood, tinder (dry leaves, fungi, fine fibers).
- **Tools:** Flint stones, hard and soft wood sticks.

## Variants and improvements

- **Torches:** For light transport.
- **Controlled bonfires:** For cooking and heat.
- **Matches and lighters:** Modern versions for instant ignition.

## Limits and risks

- **Wildfires:** Can spread out of control destroying ecosystems or homes.
- **Burns:** Direct damage to living tissues.
- **Asphyxiation:** Smoke in closed places can be deadly.
