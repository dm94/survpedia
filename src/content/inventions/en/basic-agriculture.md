# Brief description

Basic agriculture is the deliberate cultivation of plants for food, fiber, and other products. It marked the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled societies, enabling population growth and the development of civilizations.

## Use / Function

- **Food production:** Reliable supply of calories (grains, tubers, legumes).
- **Resource management:** Selection of desirable plant traits (domestication).
- **Sedentarism:** Allows humans to live in one place permanently.
- **Surplus:** Production of more food than needed for immediate survival, enabling trade and specialized labor.

## Operating principle

Agriculture exploits the natural life cycle of plants (seed, germination, growth, reproduction) by controlling the environment:
1. **Soil preparation:** Clearing land and loosening soil to facilitate root growth.
2. **Sowing:** Placing seeds at the correct depth and spacing.
3. **Maintenance:** Protecting plants from competitors (weeds) and pests.
4. **Harvesting:** Collecting the useful parts of the plant at maturity.

## How to create it

The most basic form of agriculture (horticulture) requires:
1. **Cleared land:** Use of fire or tools to remove wild vegetation.
2. **Digging tool:** A simple pointed stick (digging stick) to make holes for seeds or tubers.
3. **Water source:** Dependence on rainfall or proximity to rivers/lakes.
4. **Seed selection:** Saving the best seeds from one harvest for the next planting.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Seeds or cuttings, fertile soil, water.
- **Tools:**
  - Digging stick: Hardwood.
  - Hoe: Stone or bone blade attached to a wooden handle.
  - Sickle: Flint or bone blades set in a curved wooden or bone handle for harvesting.

## Variants and improvements

- **Shifting cultivation:** Clearing a patch of forest, farming it for a few years, then moving on (slash-and-burn).
- **Permanent fields:** Continuous use of the same land, often requiring fertilization.
- **Ploughing:** Using animals to pull a heavy blade through the soil (advanced).
- **Industrial agriculture:** Use of machinery, synthetic fertilizers, and genetic engineering.

## Limits and risks

- **Crop Failure:** Dependence on weather (drought, frost) can lead to famine.
- **Pests and Diseases:** Monocultures are vulnerable to rapid spread of infections.
- **Soil Exhaustion:** Continuous farming without replenishment depletes nutrients.
- **Sedentary Diseases:** High-density living near domesticated animals increases the risk of zoonotic diseases.
