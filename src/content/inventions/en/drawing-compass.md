# Brief description

A technical drawing instrument that can be used for inscribing circles or arcs. As dividers, they are also used as a tool to measure distances, in particular on maps. It consists of two parts (legs) connected by a hinge which can be adjusted to change the radius of the circle drawn or the distance measured.

## Use / Function

- **Geometry**: Drawing perfect circles and arcs.
- **Navigation**: Measuring distances on maps (using dividers).
- **Carpentry**: Marking measurements and scribing (transferring profiles).
- **Masonry**: Laying out stone patterns.

## Operating principle

The compass works on the principle of a fixed radius. By fixing one leg (the needle point) and rotating the other leg (the drawing point) around it, a circle is created. The distance between the two legs determines the radius. Friction at the hinge keeps the legs at a constant angle.

## How to create it

1.  **Legs**: Shape two straight legs from wood, bone, or metal. They should be sturdy and straight.
2.  **Hinge**: Connect the two legs at the top.
    - _Simple_: Tie them together tightly with cord/[leather](/en/materials/leather) (lash compass).
    - _Better_: Use a rivet or a screw that allows movement but provides enough friction to hold the position.
3.  **Points**:
    - _Anchor Point_: Sharpen one leg to a point or attach a metal needle.
    - _Drawing Point_: The other leg can also be sharp (for scratching/scribing) or have a holder for charcoal, lead, or ink.

## Materials needed

- **Legs**: Hardwood, Bone, Brass, Iron, or Steel.
- **Hinge**: [Leather](/en/materials/leather) thong, rivet, or screw.
- **Tips**: Hardened steel or iron for the points; charcoal or lead for drawing.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dividers**: Both legs have sharp points. Used solely for measuring and transferring distances.
- **Beam Compass**: Two points slide along a beam (rod) to draw very large circles.
- **Spring Compass**: A spring bow holds the legs apart, and a screw adjusts the distance, offering greater precision.
- **Calipers**: Curved legs for measuring outside or inside diameters of objects.

## Limits and risks

- **Slip**: The anchor point can slip if not pressed firmly, ruining the drawing.
- **Accuracy**: A loose hinge leads to inaccurate circles.
- **Size**: Limited by the length of the legs (unless using a beam compass).
