# Brief description

A mouse trap is a small mechanical device that captures or kills mice by releasing stored energy when a baited trigger is disturbed.

## Use / Function

- **Pest control:** Protects grain stores, kitchens, and shelters.
- **Disease reduction:** Limits contamination from rodents.
- **Low-cost protection:** Simple parts and quick reset.
- **Scale:** Household, barn, and granary use.

## Operating principle

A baited trigger holds a spring bar, wire loop, or door under tension. When a mouse pulls or steps on the trigger, the latch releases and the moving part snaps shut or closes a cage, preventing escape.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare the base:** Cut a small plank of **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** and smooth the edges.
2. **Form the spring:** Shape a strong **[Wire](/en/inventions/wire)** bar from **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**.
3. **Build the trigger:** Carve a notch-and-peg trigger and add a bait hook.
4. **Set the latch:** Tension the spring and secure it on the trigger.
5. **Place and test:** Position along walls, bait lightly, and test with a tap.

Technical level: Basic woodworking and careful spring handling.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** base, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** spring bar, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for lashings or a bait line.
- **Tools:** Knife, saw, awl or drill, pliers.
- **Substitutes:** **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** noose trap, a small **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** deadfall, or a simple **[Cage trap](/en/inventions/traps)** trigger.

## Variants and improvements

- **Snap bar:** Strong spring bar for quick kill.
- **Box trap:** Enclosed live-capture design.
- **Bucket trap:** Rolling log or tipping lid over a container.
- **Deadfall plate:** Flat stone or board dropped by a trigger.
- **Resettable trap:** Balanced trigger for multiple catches.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Can harm pets or useful wildlife.
- **Handling risk:** Springs can injure fingers if set carelessly.
- **Trap shyness:** Poor baiting reduces effectiveness.
- **Hygiene:** Carcasses can carry disease if mishandled.
- **Regulation:** Local rules may restrict lethal traps.
