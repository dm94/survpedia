# Brief description

A milling machine is a versatile machine tool that uses a rotating multi-tooth cutter, known as a **[Milling Cutter](/en/inventions/milling-cutter)**, to remove material from a workpiece. Unlike a lathe, where the workpiece rotates, in a milling machine, the cutter rotates while the workpiece is moved against it.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** Machining flat surfaces, slots, pockets, and complex shapes in metal, wood, or plastic.
- **Secondary Uses:** Drilling, boring, and gear cutting (with an indexing head).
- **Scale:** Industrial/Workshop. Essential for creating other machines.

## Operating principle

The milling machine operates on the principle of rotary cutting. A spindle rotates a cutting tool (end mill, face mill) at high speed. The workpiece is clamped to a table that can move along three axes (X, Y, and Z). By feeding the workpiece into the rotating cutter, material is sheared away in the form of chips.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Horizontal Mill)

1.  **Frame:** A heavy, rigid structure (cast iron or heavy steel) to dampen vibrations.
2.  **Spindle:** A horizontal shaft driven by a motor (or water/steam power) to hold the cutter.
3.  **Table:** A flat surface with T-slots to clamp the work, mounted on slides to move horizontally and vertically.
4.  **Feed Mechanism:** Handwheels connected to lead screws to move the table precisely.

### Intermediate version (Vertical Mill)

1.  **Vertical Spindle:** The spindle is mounted vertically, allowing the use of end mills for plunging and pocketing.
2.  **Quill:** The spindle can be moved up and down (Z-axis) for drilling operations.
3.  **Knee:** The entire table assembly moves up and down the column for major Z-axis adjustments.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Cast Iron:** For the base, column, and table (provides mass and damping).
  - **Steel:** For the spindle, lead screws, and cutting tools (**[Milling Cutters](/en/inventions/milling-cutter)**).
  - **Bronze:** For bearings and lead screw nuts (sacrificial wear parts).
- **Tools:** **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)** (to make the spindle and screws), **[Drill Press](/en/inventions/drill-press)**, **[Scraper](/en/inventions/scraper)** (for flattening ways).

## Variants and improvements

- **Horizontal Mill:** Better for heavy material removal and gang milling.
- **Vertical Mill:** More versatile for die sinking and detailed work.
- **Universal Mill:** The table can swivel, allowing for spiral cutting (e.g., helical gears).
- **CNC Mill:** Computer-controlled for automated, complex machining.

## Relationship with Lathes and Drills

The Milling Machine, the **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)**, and the **[Drill Press](/en/inventions/drill-press)** are complementary.

- While the lathe rotates the workpiece, the milling machine rotates the tool.
- The milling machine can perform many drilling operations, but the drill press is faster and more efficient for simple holes.
- The cutters used in the milling machine can be sharpened or partially manufactured on a lathe.

## Limits and risks

- **Vibration:** Lack of rigidity causes "chatter," ruining the surface finish and breaking tools.
- **Backlash:** Play in the lead screws can cause inaccuracies; climb milling is dangerous on manual machines with backlash.
- **Safety:** Rotating cutters can catch loose clothing or hair. Flying chips are hot and sharp.
- **Complexity:** Requires precise alignment of all axes (tramming) to cut square.
