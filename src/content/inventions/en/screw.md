# Brief description

A screw is a simple machine consisting of an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder or cone. It is primarily used to hold objects together or to lift materials.

## Use / Function

- **Fastening:** Joining two or more objects together securely (e.g., wood screws, bolts).
- **Motion Conversion:** Converting rotational motion into linear motion (e.g., lead screws in machinery).
- **Lifting:** Raising water or granular materials (e.g., Archimedes' screw).
- **Pressing:** Applying great force for squeezing or crushing (e.g., wine press, printing press).
- **Scale:** From tiny watch components to massive industrial presses.

## Operating Principle

The screw works by converting torque (rotational force) into linear force. The distance between the threads is called the "pitch."

- **Mechanical Advantage:** A small rotational force applied over a long distance (the circumference of the turn) creates a large axial force over a short distance (the pitch).
- **Self-locking:** In many screw designs, friction prevents the screw from turning back under load, keeping it secure.

## How to create it

1.  **Preparation:** Select a cylindrical rod of wood or metal.
2.  **Marking:** Draw a diagonal line around the cylinder to define the thread path (helix).
3.  **Cutting:**
    - **Wood:** Carve out the material between the marked lines to create the thread profile.
    - **Metal:** Use a file or a harder cutting tool (die) to cut the threads.
4.  **Matching:** Create a corresponding internal thread (nut) by tapping a hole or carving the inside of a hollow cylinder.

## Materials needed

- **Rod:** Hardwood (oak, hickory) or metal (bronze, iron, steel).
- **Cutting Tools:** Chisels, files, or harder metal cutters.
- **Lubricant:** Tallow or oil to ease the cutting and movement.

## Variants and improvements

- **Archimedes' Screw:** A large screw inside a pipe used for lifting water.
- **Wood Screw:** Tapered point for penetrating wood.
- **Machine Screw/Bolt:** Uniform cylinder for use with a nut.
- **Ball Screw:** Uses ball bearings for low friction (modern high-precision).

## Limits and risks

- **Stripping:** Applying too much torque can shear off the threads, rendering the screw useless.
- **Friction:** A significant amount of input energy is lost to friction.
- **Corrosion:** Metal screws can rust and seize, making them impossible to remove.
