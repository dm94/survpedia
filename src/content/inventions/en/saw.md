# Brief description

A tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, most often wood, although sometimes metal or stone.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to cut materials into desired shapes and sizes.

- Primary use: Cutting wood for construction, fuel, or carpentry.
- Secondary uses: Cutting metal (hacksaw), stone (masonry saw), or bone (surgery).
- Scale: From small precision work to large-scale forestry.

## Operating principle

The saw works by abrasion or cutting. The teeth of the saw act as a series of small knives or chisels.

- **Mechanical Action**: When the saw is moved back and forth (reciprocating motion), each tooth removes a small amount of material.
- **Kerf**: The cut made by the saw is called a kerf. The teeth are often "set" (bent alternately to the left and right) to make the kerf wider than the blade, preventing it from binding.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
A jagged edge on a hard material.

- **Stone Age**: A piece of flint or obsidian with a serrated edge (denticulation).
- **Iron/Steel Age**: A metal strip with teeth filed into one edge.

### Fabrication steps (Metal Saw)
1.  **Forging**: Shape a flat bar of iron or steel.
2.  **Toothing**: Use a chisel or file to cut teeth into one edge.
3.  **Setting**: Bend the teeth slightly in alternating directions (one left, one right) to create clearance for the blade.
4.  **Hardening**: Heat and quench the blade (especially the teeth) to keep it sharp.
5.  **Hafting**: Attach a wooden handle for grip.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Blade**: Iron, Steel (best for durability), or Flint/Obsidian (primitive).
    - **Handle**: Wood, Bone, or Antler.
- **Tools**:
    - **File**: To sharpen the teeth.
    - **Hammer & Anvil**: To shape the blade.
    - **Pliers/Wrench**: To set the teeth.

## Variants and improvements

- **Hand Saw**: General purpose woodworking.
- **Crosscut Saw**: Two-man saw for felling large trees.
- **Hacksaw**: Fine teeth for cutting metal.
- **Bow Saw**: A thin blade held in tension by a frame.
- **Chainsaw**: Modern powered variant with a rotating chain.

## Limits and risks

- **Dulling**: Teeth lose their edge and require frequent sharpening (filing).
- **Binding**: If the kerf is too narrow or the wood pinches, the saw can get stuck.
- **Kickback**: If the saw catches, it can jump out of the cut.
- **Physical effort**: Manual sawing is labor-intensive.
