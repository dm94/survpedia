# Brief description

A microscope is an optical instrument that uses one or more lenses to magnify minute objects that are invisible to the naked eye, such as cells, bacteria, and crystal structures.

## Use / Function

- **Scientific Observation:** Viewing the microscopic world (biology, medicine).
- **Diagnosis:** Identifying parasites and pathogens in blood or water.
- **Material Analysis:** Inspecting the structure of metals, crystals, and fibers.
- **Quality Control:** Examining precision parts for defects.

## Operating principle

It uses **refraction** through a system of lenses:

1.  **Objective Lens:** A very strong convex lens placed close to the object. It creates a magnified "real image" inside the tube.
2.  **Eyepiece (Ocular):** Another convex lens that acts as a magnifying glass, further enlarging the image created by the objective lens for the eye.
3.  **Illumination:** Light is focused through the sample (often using a mirror or condenser lens) to make it visible.

## How to create it

1.  **Lens Fabrication:** Create two high-quality convex lenses. The objective lens must have a very short focal length (very curved). The eyepiece can be a standard magnifier.
2.  **Tube Construction:** Mount the lenses at opposite ends of a light-tight tube. The distance between them must be adjustable to focus.
3.  **Stand and Stage:** Build a stable stand to hold the tube. Add a flat stage to hold the sample.
4.  **Lighting:** Place a small adjustable mirror below the stage to reflect light up through the sample.

**Technical Level:** Advanced. Requires high-precision lenses and a stable mechanical structure.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** High-quality **[Lenses](/en/inventions/lens)** (glass or quartz).
- **Structure:** Metal (**[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, iron) or fine wood for the tube and stand.
- **Tools:** Lathe, glass grinding tools, drills.
- **Substitutes:** A single tiny glass bead (van Leeuwenhoek style) can act as a powerful single-lens microscope if mounted in a small metal plate.

## Variants and improvements

- **Simple Microscope:** A single high-power lens (like van Leeuwenhoek's). Hard to use but effective.
- **Compound Microscope:** Two or more lenses (Objective + Eyepiece). Easier to use and higher magnification.
- **Electron Microscope:** Uses electron beams instead of light (modern, high-tech).

## Limits and risks

- **Resolution Limit:** Optical microscopes are limited by the wavelength of light (approx. 0.2 micrometers).
- **Lighting:** Requires bright light; too much heat from the light source can damage the sample.
- **Depth of Field:** Only a very thin slice of the object is in focus at one time.
