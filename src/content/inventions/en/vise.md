# Brief description

A vise (or vice) is a mechanical apparatus used to secure an object to allow work to be performed on it. Vises have two parallel jaws, one fixed and the other movable, threaded in and out by a screw and lever.

## Use / Function

- **Holding:** Securely clamping workpieces for sawing, filing, drilling, or gluing.
- **Metalworking:** Holding metal for hammering or bending.
- **Woodworking:** Holding wood for planing or sawing.
- **Scale:** Essential for any workshop.

## Operating principle

A large screw (lead screw) moves a sliding jaw towards a fixed jaw. The mechanical advantage of the screw allows a user to apply massive clamping force with moderate effort on the handle.

## How to create it

### Primitive version (Woodworking Vise)

1.  **Jaws:** Two thick blocks of hardwood.
2.  **Screw:** A large wooden screw (can be carved or made with a tap and die).
3.  **Guide:** Two smooth rods (wood or metal) to keep the jaws parallel.
4.  **Mount:** The fixed jaw is attached to the workbench leg.

### Advanced version (Bench Vise)

1.  **Body:** Cast iron body (fixed jaw) bolted to the bench.
2.  **Slide:** A movable jaw on a square or dovetail slide.
3.  **Screw:** A heavy steel acme-thread screw.
4.  **Jaws:** Hardened steel faceplates with cross-hatching for grip (replaceable).

## Materials needed

- **Cast Iron:** For the body (mass and strength).
- **Steel:** For the screw and jaw inserts.
- **Wood:** For softer vises or jaw pads (to protect delicate work).

## Variants and improvements

- **Bench Vise:** The standard machinist's vise.
- **Machine Vise:** Low profile, precision ground, used on **[Milling Machines](/en/inventions/milling-machine)** and **[Drill Presses](/en/inventions/drill-press)**.
- **Pipe Vise:** V-shaped jaws to hold round pipes.
- **Leg Vise:** Has a leg that reaches the floor to take the force of heavy hammering (blacksmithing).

## Limits and risks

- **Over-tightening:** Can crush the workpiece or strip the screw threads.
- **Marring:** Hard steel jaws will mark soft materials (aluminum, wood). Use "soft jaws" (copper/wood pads).
- **Cracking:** Cast iron vises can crack if struck hard with a hammer (unless it's a specific blacksmith leg vise).
