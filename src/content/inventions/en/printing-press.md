# Brief description

The printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It was a revolutionary invention that allowed for the mass production of books and the rapid spread of information.

## Use / Function

Its primary purpose is the mass reproduction of text and images:

- **Mass Communication:** Rapid dissemination of ideas, news, and knowledge.
- **Education:** Making books affordable and accessible to a larger population.
- **Standardization:** Ensuring uniformity in copies of texts, laws, and scientific data.
- **Scientific Revolution:** Facilitated the sharing of discoveries and data among scholars.

## Operating principle

The printing press operates on several key principles:

1. **Movable Type:** Individual characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) are cast in a durable metal alloy. These can be rearranged to form any text.
2. **Type Metal:** An alloy of lead, tin, and antimony that melts at a low temperature, casts sharply, and expands slightly upon cooling to fill the mold perfectly.
3. **Oil-based Ink:** Unlike water-based inks used for handwriting, printing ink must be thick and oily to adhere to the metal type and transfer cleanly to paper.
4. **The Press Mechanism:** A screw or lever mechanism applies even, heavy pressure to a flat plate (the platen), pressing the paper against the inked type.

## How to create it

- **Step 1: Build the Frame:** A sturdy frame (originally wood, later iron) to hold the mechanism.
- **Step 2: Create the Type:** Cast individual letters in molds using type metal alloy.
- **Step 3: Prepare the Ink:** Mix soot or charcoal with linseed oil and resin to create a thick, tacky ink.
- **Step 4: Setting the Type:** Arrange the characters in a "chase" (a metal frame) to form the page of text.
- **Step 5: Printing:** Apply ink to the type using leather ink balls, place the paper on top, and use the press to apply pressure.

## Materials needed

- **Frame:** Wood (Oak) or Iron.
- **Type:** Lead, Tin, and Antimony alloy.
- **Surface:** Paper or Parchment.
- **Ink:** Linseed oil, Charcoal/Soot, and Resin.
- **Tools:** Type molds, leather ink balls, composing sticks, and chases.

## Variants and improvements

- **Woodblock Printing:** Preceded the press; used carved wooden blocks for entire pages.
- **Gutenberg Press:** The first screw-press with movable metal type (15th century).
- **Steam-powered Press:** Dramatically increased printing speed in the 19th century.
- **Offset Printing:** Modern industrial method where the inked image is transferred from a plate to a rubber blanket.
- **Digital Printing:** Inkjet and laser technologies that do not require physical plates or type.

## Limits and risks

- **Mechanical Wear:** Metal type eventually wears down and needs to be recast.
- **Complexity:** Requires precision in casting type and aligning the press.
- **Resource Intensive:** Requires significant amounts of metal, oil, and high-quality paper.
- **Censorship:** Because of its power to spread ideas, the press has often been a target of government or religious control.
