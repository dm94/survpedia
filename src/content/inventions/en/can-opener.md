# Brief description

A device used to open steel or tin cans (metal containers). Early cans were robust and required a hammer and chisel; the dedicated can opener appeared later as cans became thinner.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Cutting through the lid of metal cans to access contents.
- **Scale**: Domestic, military.

## Operating principle

Most manual can openers use a lever to puncture the lid and a rotating wheel or blade to shear the metal along the rim.
- **Leverage**: To puncture the metal.
- **Shearing**: To cut the metal as the opener moves around the circumference.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Blade**: A sharp, curved steel hook or blade (like the P-38 military opener).
2.  **Fulcrum**: A notch or hook that catches the rim of the can to provide leverage.
3.  **Operation**: The user rocks the blade to puncture and cut, inching around the rim.

### Technical level
- **Intermediate**: Requires precise shaping of the hardened steel blade and fulcrum notch.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Steel**: Must be hardened to cut through tinplate/steel cans without dulling quickly.
- **Tools**:
    - **Forge/Grinder**: To shape the cutting edge and rim hook.

## Variants and improvements

- **Lever-type (Claw)**: Simple blade that punches through (e.g., classic pocket knife tool).
- **Rotating Wheel**: A serrated wheel grips the rim while a cutting wheel shears the lid (modern kitchen opener).
- **P-38/P-51**: Tiny, folding military openers.
- **Safety Opener**: Cuts the side of the rim, leaving no sharp edges.

## Limits and risks

- **Sharp Edges**: Both the opener blade and the cut lid are extremely sharp and can cause lacerations.
- **Metal Shavings**: Poor quality openers may drop metal filings into the food.
- **Rust**: The cutting mechanism is prone to rust if not dried after washing.
