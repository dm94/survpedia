# Brief description

A measuring container (cup, cylinder, or beaker) is a tool used to quantify the volume of liquids or pourable solids (like flour or grain). It relies on a known capacity marked on the vessel, allowing for consistent replication of recipes, chemical mixtures, and trade goods.

## Use / Function

- **Cooking/Baking:** Measuring ingredients like water, milk, oil, or flour for recipes.
- **Chemistry/Medicine:** Precisely measuring reagents or liquid doses.
- **Trade:** Selling goods by volume (grain, wine, oil) rather than weight.
- **Scale:** Domestic (cups) to Industrial (barrels/tanks).

## Operating principle

**Displacement / Capacity.**
The container has a defined internal volume. When filled to a specific mark (graduation), the substance occupies that known volume.

1.  **Calibration:** The container is marked based on a standard unit (liter, cup, gallon).
2.  **Filling:** Liquid is poured until its surface (meniscus) reaches the desired mark.
3.  **Reading:** The volume is read directly from the scale.

## How to create it

### 1. Simple Volume Standard (The Cup)

- **Find a container:** A gourd, horn, or clay pot.
- **Calibrate:** Fill it with a known weight of water (since 1g of water ≈ 1ml). Mark the level.
- **Replicate:** Use this master cup to fill others or mark levels on them.

### 2. Graduated Cylinder (Precision)

- **Form:** Create a tall, narrow cylinder (glass or transparent material is best). Narrower vessels reduce reading errors.
- **Marking:** Add water in small, known increments (e.g., using a small spoon or weight). Mark each level on the outside.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Container Material:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** (transparent, non-reactive), **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** (opaque but sturdy), **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)**, or **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)**.
- **Tools:**
  - **Marking Tool:** Etching tool for glass, paint for clay/metal.
  - **Standard:** A known weight of water or another standard vessel.
- **Substitutes:**
  - **Natural containers:** Bamboo sections, gourds, shells.

## Variants and improvements

- **Measuring Cup:** Wide mouth, handle, spout. Good for cooking.
- **Graduated Cylinder:** Tall, narrow. High precision for science.
- **Pipette/Burette:** For moving or dispensing very small, precise volumes.
- **Volumetric Flask:** Designed to hold a single, precise volume at a specific temperature.

## Limits and risks

- **Meniscus Error:** Water curves at the edges; read the bottom of the curve.
- **Parallax:** Reading from an angle causes errors; read at eye level.
- **Temperature:** Liquids expand with heat; precision glassware is calibrated for a specific temperature (usually 20°C).
- **Material Reactivity:** Some metals react with acids (vinegar, lemon juice). Glass is safest.
