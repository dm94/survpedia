# Brief description

A metalworking and woodworking tool used to cut fine amounts of material from a workpiece. It consists of a hardened steel bar with a series of sharp, parallel teeth or ridges.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is abrasion and smoothing.

- **Sharpening**: Essential for maintaining other tools like saws, axes, and knives.
- **Smoothing**: Removing burrs and rough edges from metal or wood objects.
- **Shaping**: Precise removal of material to achieve a specific fit or shape.

## Operating principle

The file works by shearing. Each tooth on the file acts as a tiny blade that cuts a shaving from the material being worked.

- **Direction**: Most files cut only on the forward stroke (push stroke). Dragging it back dulls the teeth.
- **Hardness**: The file must be harder than the material it is filing.

## How to create it

### Fabrication steps

1.  **Forging**: Shape a high-carbon steel blank into the desired profile (flat, round, half-round).
2.  **Annealing**: Soften the steel so the teeth can be cut.
3.  **Grinding**: Grind the surface flat and smooth.
4.  **Cutting**: Use a sharp, hard chisel to strike the file blank at an angle, raising a burr (the tooth). This is done repeatedly and precisely along the length.
5.  **Hardening**: This is the most critical step. The file is heated to critical temperature and quenched (usually in brine) to make it extremely hard. It is often left un-tempered or only lightly tempered to maximize hardness.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **High-Carbon Steel**: Essential for holding a sharp edge and being harder than other metals.
- **Tools**:
  - **Chisel**: A special short, hard chisel for cutting the teeth.
  - **Hammer**: For striking the chisel.

## Variants and improvements

- **Rasp**: Has individual raised teeth, used for wood and soft materials (coarser removal).
- **Single-cut**: Rows of parallel teeth (smoother finish).
- **Double-cut**: Two sets of diagonal rows crossing each other (faster removal).
- **Needle Files**: Very small files for precision work (jewelry, clockmaking).

## Limits and risks

- **Brittle**: Because they are very hard, files are brittle and can snap if used as a lever or struck.
- **Pinning**: Soft metals (like aluminum or copper) can clog the teeth. A file card (brush) is needed to clean it.
- **Rust**: High carbon steel rusts easily.
