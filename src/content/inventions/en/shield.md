# Brief description

A shield is a piece of personal armor held in the hand or strapped to the arm. It is used to intercept specific attacks, whether from close-range weaponry or projectiles like arrows, by means of active blocks.

## Use / Function

- **Defense**: Blocks or deflects incoming attacks (swords, spears, arrows).
- **Offense**: Can be used to bash or push opponents (shield bash).
- **Formation**: Used in groups to create a defensive wall (shield wall).

## Operating principle

The shield acts as a mobile barrier. It absorbs the kinetic energy of a blow or deflects it away from the user's body. The surface area covers vital organs, and the material must be strong enough to resist penetration but light enough to be carried.

## How to create it

1.  **Core Construction**:
    - **Plank Shield**: Join flat wooden planks together using glue or dowels. Cut to a circular or rectangular shape.
    - **Wicker Shield**: Weave flexible branches (willow) into a disc.
2.  **Reinforcement**: Cover the face and edge with rawhide or leather. When wet rawhide dries, it shrinks, pulling the wood together tightly and adding significant strength.
3.  **Handle**: Attach a handle (wood or leather strap) to the center back.
4.  **Boss (Optional)**: Add a metal or hard wood dome (boss) in the center to protect the hand and deflect blows.

## Materials needed

- **Base**: Wood (planks or plywood), Wicker.
- **Covering**: Rawhide, Leather.
- **Binding**: Glue (cheese glue, hide glue), nails, or rim reinforcement (metal/leather).
- **Handle**: Wood, Leather.

## Variants and improvements

- **Buckler**: Small, round shield held in the fist for agility.
- **Kite Shield**: Teardrop shape to protect the legs while on horseback.
- **Tower Shield (Scutum)**: Large rectangular shield for maximum coverage in formation.
- **Rotella**: Round shield, effective for swordsmen.

## Limits and risks

- **Weight**: A heavy shield causes fatigue, lowering the guard over time.
- **Visibility**: Large shields can obscure the user's vision.
- **Durability**: Wooden shields can be split by axes or pierced by heavy spears/arrows.
