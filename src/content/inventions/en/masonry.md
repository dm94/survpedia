# Brief description

Masonry is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**. It is one of the most durable construction techniques in history.

## Use / Function

- **Structural Walls:** Building load-bearing walls for houses, fortifications, and temples.
- **Foundations:** Creating stable bases for structures.
- **Arches and Vaults:** Spanning openings without wood or steel.
- **Paving:** Creating durable floors and roads.
- **Scale:** From small garden walls to massive cathedrals and dams.

## Operating principle

Masonry relies on **compression** and **gravity**. The individual units (bricks or stones) are stacked so their weight holds them in place. The **mortar** acts as a glue to bond them, fill gaps, and distribute the load evenly, preventing stress concentrations that could crack the units. Staggering the vertical joints (bonding) ensures the wall acts as a single cohesive unit rather than separate columns.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundation:** Ensure a stable, level base (footing) below the frost line.
2.  **Mortar Mixing:** Prepare a workable **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** mix.
3.  **First Course:** Lay a bed of mortar and place the first row of units, ensuring they are perfectly level.
4.  **Bonding:** Start the second row with a half-unit so the vertical joints do not align with the ones below.
5.  **Leveling:** Constantly check vertical (plumb) and horizontal (level) alignment using a **[Level](/en/inventions/level)** and **[Plumb Bob](/en/inventions/plumb-bob)**.
6.  **Finishing:** Strike the joints (smooth the mortar) before it hardens to improve water resistance.

## Materials needed

- **Essential Materials:** **[Bricks](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, or **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** blocks.
- **Binder:** **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** (Lime, Cement, or Mud).
- **Tools:**
  - **Trowel:** To handle and spread mortar.
  - **String Line:** To keep rows straight.
  - **Hammer/Chisel:** To cut bricks/stones.
  - **Level:** To ensure stability.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dry Stone:** Stacking stones without mortar (requires great skill).
- **Adobe:** Sun-dried mud bricks joined with mud mortar.
- **Fired Brick:** Standard modern masonry using kiln-fired bricks and [cement mortar](/en/materials/cement-mortar).
- **Ashlar:** Finely dressed (cut) stone masonry with very thin joints.
- **Reinforced Masonry:** Incorporating steel bars (rebar) into hollow blocks or cavities to add tensile strength.
- **Cavity Walls:** Two layers of masonry with a gap in between (often filled with **[Insulation](/en/materials/thermal-insulation)** like **[Mineral Wool](/en/materials/mineral-wool)** or **[Polystyrene](/en/materials/polystyrene)**) to prevent moisture penetration and improve thermal retention.

## Limits and risks

- **Tensile Strength:** Masonry is strong in compression but weak in tension. It cracks easily if the ground settles or during earthquakes unless reinforced.
- **Moisture:** Porous masonry can absorb water, leading to mold or freeze-thaw damage.
- **Labor:** It is slow and labor-intensive compared to wood framing or poured concrete.
- **Weight:** Masonry structures are very heavy and require strong foundations.
