# Brief description

A windmill is a structure that converts the kinetic energy of the wind into rotational energy using sails or blades. This energy is used to grind grain, pump water, or drive other machinery.

## Use / Function

- **Milling:** Grinding grain into flour (gristmill).
- **Pumping:** Draining wetlands or pumping water for irrigation (windpump).
- **Sawing:** Cutting timber in sawmills.
- **Industrial:** Crushing seeds for oil, processing **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)**, or fulling cloth.
- **Scale:** Industrial / Local community.

## Operating principle

1.  **Capture:** Wind pushes against the angled sails or blades, creating lift and drag that rotates the windshaft.
2.  **Transmission:** The windshaft (horizontal or slightly inclined) connects to a large brake [wheel](/en/inventions/wheel).
3.  **Gearing:** The brake wheel drives a wallower (lantern gear) on a vertical main shaft, converting the motion from horizontal to vertical.
4.  **Application:** The vertical shaft drives the millstones (via a spur [wheel](/en/inventions/wheel) and stone nuts) or a scoop wheel/Archimedes' screw for pumping.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundation:** Build a stable base (brick, stone, or timber trestle) to support the weight and resist wind forces.
2.  **Structure:** Construct the tower or body. For a "Post Mill," the whole body rotates on a central post. For a "Tower Mill," only the cap rotates.
3.  **Sails:** Construct the framework for the sails (usually 4) from light, strong wood. Cover with canvas (fabric) sails that can be adjusted based on wind speed.
4.  **Mechanism:** Install the windshaft, brake wheel, vertical shaft, and gearing. Use hard wood (like oak) or iron.
5.  **Millstones:** Install the bedstone (fixed) and runner stone (rotating).
6.  **Orientation:** Add a tail pole or fantail to manually or automatically turn the sails into the wind.

## Materials needed

- **Structure:** Strong timber (oak) or masonry (brick/stone) for the tower.
- **Sails:** Light timber lattice and strong **fabric** (canvas) or wooden shutters.
- **Gears:** Hardwood (apple, hornbeam) or cast iron for durability.
- **Millstones:** Hard, abrasive stone (burrstone, granite).
- **Rope:** For controlling the sails and brake.

## Variants and improvements

- **Post Mill:** The earliest type; the whole building turns to face the wind. Limited size.
- **Tower/Smock Mill:** Only the top cap rotates. Allows for a larger, more stable building.
- **Fantail:** A small fan at the back that automatically turns the cap into the wind.
- **Spring/Patent Sails:** Shutters that open/close automatically to regulate speed, replacing manual canvas handling.

## Limits and risks

- **Intermittency:** Does not work without wind; useless in calm weather.
- **Storms:** High winds can destroy the sails or burn down the mill (friction fire) if the brake fails.
- **Maintenance:** Sails wear out quickly; gears need constant greasing (animal fat).
- **Safety:** The rotating sails are heavy and fast; being struck is fatal. Brake failure can lead to runaway speed.
