# Brief description

A crane is a machine equipped with a hoist rope, wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places.

## Use / Function

- **Heavy Lifting:** Moving heavy materials that are beyond human capacity.
- **Construction:** Lifting beams, blocks, and other structural components to high places.
- **Loading/Unloading:** Transferring cargo between ships and docks or trucks and warehouses.
- **Assembly:** Positioning heavy machinery or parts during manufacturing.

## Operating principle

The crane operates on the principle of mechanical advantage. It uses one or more [simple machines](/en/inventions/simple-machines) to create mechanical advantage and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human.

- **Lever:** The jib or beam acts as a [lever](/en/inventions/lever), allowing a smaller force to lift a larger load.
- **Pulley:** A system of [pulleys](/en/inventions/pulley) (block and tackle) reduces the force required to lift the load.
- **Winch:** A [winch](/en/inventions/winch) winds the cable to lift the load.
- **Counterweight:** A heavy weight on the opposite side of the lifting arm balances the load and prevents tipping.

## How to create it

1.  **Base:** Construct a stable base. For a stationary crane, this must be firmly anchored to the ground. For a mobile crane, it needs a wide, heavy chassis.
2.  **Mast:** Erect a vertical mast (tower) that provides height. This must be strong enough to withstand compression forces.
3.  **Jib (Arm):** Attach a horizontal or angled arm to the top of the mast. This supports the load.
4.  **Rotating Mechanism:** Create a pivot point where the mast or jib can rotate to move the load horizontally.
5.  **Lifting Mechanism:** Install a [pulley](/en/inventions/pulley) at the end of the jib and a [winch](/en/inventions/winch) at the base or on the arm. Thread a strong [rope](/en/materials/rope) or [steel cable](/en/materials/steel-cable) through the pulley.
6.  **Counterweight:** Add heavy stones or metal weights to the short end of the jib or the back of the base to balance the lifting arm.

## Materials needed

- **Structural Material:** Strong timber (oak, pine) or steel beams for the mast and jib.
- **Cable:** High-tensile strength rope (hemp) or steel cable.
- **Mechanism:** Iron or steel for pulleys, axles, and gears.
- **Counterweights:** Stones, concrete blocks, or scrap metal.

## Variants and improvements

- **Treadwheel Crane:** An ancient Roman design powered by men walking inside a large wheel.
- **Jib Crane:** A simple crane with a horizontal arm (jib) and a movable hoist.
- **Tower Crane:** A modern crane fixed to the ground on a concrete slab, offering the best combination of height and lifting capacity.
- **Mobile Crane:** Mounted on a truck or crawler for easy transport.

## Limits and risks

- **Tipping:** If the load exceeds the counterweight's capacity or the center of gravity shifts too far, the crane can tip over.
- **Cable Failure:** Snapping cables can drop the load, causing injury or damage.
- **Wind:** High winds can destabilize the load and the crane structure.
- **Swinging Loads:** Uncontrolled swinging can hit structures or people.
