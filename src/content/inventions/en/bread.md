# Brief description

Bread is a baked food made from cereal dough, providing durable and portable calories. It can be flat or leavened and adapts to many grains and environments.

## Use / Function

- **Staple food**: Dense energy for daily meals.
- **Portability**: Easy to transport and portion.
- **Preservation**: Baking stabilizes dough and slows spoilage.
- **Scale**: Household to community ovens.

## Operating principle

- Water hydrates flour to form a workable dough.
- Kneading aligns gluten to trap gas.
- **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)** produces CO2 that expands the dough.
- Heat sets the structure as starch gelatinizes and proteins coagulate, forming crust and crumb.

## How to create it

- **Minimum functional version (flatbread)**:
  1. Grind **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** or other grain into flour with a **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**.
  2. Mix flour with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** to form a stiff dough.
  3. Flatten and cook on a hot stone or in a **[Kiln / Oven](/en/inventions/kiln)** near **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**.
- **Minimum functional version (leavened)**:
  1. Add **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or a sourdough starter.
  2. Let the dough rise, then shape and bake.
- **Technical level**: Basic for flatbreads, intermediate for leavened breads with controlled fermentation.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: Grain flour, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**, **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or starter.
- **Tools**: **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, **[Kiln / Oven](/en/inventions/kiln)**.
- **Possible substitutes**: **[Maize](/en/materials/maize)**, **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)**, or **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** for flatbreads when wheat is unavailable.

## Variants and improvements

- **Flatbread**: Fast, no fermentation.
- **Sourdough**: Wild starter for flavor and shelf life.
- **Steamed bread**: Uses steam instead of dry baking.
- **Enriched bread**: Added fats or sugars for softness.
- **Hardtack**: Low moisture for long storage.

## Limits and risks

- **Staling**: Bread dries and hardens without sealed storage.
- **Spoilage**: Underbaked loaves can mold quickly.
- **Gluten sensitivity**: Wheat bread is unsuitable for some diets.
- **Smoke and ash**: Open-fire baking can contaminate flavor and surface.
