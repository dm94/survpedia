# Brief description

A shovel is a tool for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials, such as soil, coal, gravel, snow, sand, or ore. It is an evolution of the simple digging stick.

## Use / Function

- **Digging:** Excavating trenches, holes for posts, or foundations.
- **Agriculture:** Turning over soil, planting, and harvesting root crops.
- **Construction:** Moving loose materials like sand, cement, or earth.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

It combines two simple machines:

- **Wedge:** The sharp edge of the blade cuts into the material.
- **Lever:** The long handle allows the user to lift heavy loads with less force using the hands as a fulcrum.

## How to create it

1.  **Blade Selection:** Find a flat, broad material. A large animal shoulder blade (scapula), a flat stone, or a carved piece of hardwood.
2.  **Handle:** Select a straight, sturdy branch.
3.  **Assembly:**
    - **Bone/Stone:** Lash the handle to the blade using wet rawhide or strong cordage. A split-stick mount can hold a stone blade.
    - **Wood:** Can be carved from a single piece of log (monoxylous).
    - **Metal:** Forge a blade with a socket to accept the wooden handle.
4.  **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate (depending on material).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Blade:** Hardwood, Bone (Scapula), Stone, or Metal.
  - **Handle:** Strong wood (Ash, Hickory).
- **Tools:** Knife, Axe, or abrasive stones for shaping.
- **Substitutes:** Digging stick, large shell, hands.

## Variants and improvements

- **Digging Stick:** The simplest precursor; a sharpened stick hardened by fire.
- **Spade:** Designed specifically for digging, often with a flatter blade and shorter handle.
- **Square-point shovel:** Better for moving loose material from a flat surface.
- **Round-point shovel:** Better for digging into hard ground.

## Limits and risks

- **Durability:** Wooden or bone shovels wear out quickly in rocky soil.
- **Ergonomics:** Improper use can lead to severe back strain or repetitive strain injuries.
- **Efficiency:** Moving large amounts of earth by hand is extremely energy-intensive.
