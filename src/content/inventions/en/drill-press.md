# Brief description

A drill press is a stationary machine tool used for drilling precise holes in wood, metal, or plastic. It consists of a base, column, table, and a power head with a rotating spindle. It offers far greater accuracy and power than a hand drill.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** Drilling holes perfectly perpendicular to the surface.
- **Secondary Uses:** Reaming, tapping (threading), counterboring, and sanding (with drum attachments).
- **Scale:** Workshop/Industrial.

## Operating principle

A motor drives a spindle via a belt and pulley system (to change speeds). The spindle holds a chuck or taper for the drill bit. A feed lever (quill) moves the rotating spindle vertically down into the workpiece, which is clamped or held on an adjustable table.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Post Drill)

1.  **Frame:** A sturdy wooden or metal post bolted to a wall or bench.
2.  **Spindle:** A vertical shaft with a hand crank or flywheel for momentum.
3.  **Feed:** A screw mechanism to advance the bit as it turns (automatic feed) or a simple lever.

### Intermediate version (Belt Driven)

1.  **Column:** A rigid steel pipe or cast iron column.
2.  **Head:** Contains the spindle bearings and quill assembly.
3.  **Drive:** A system of stepped pulleys to allow different speeds (slow for metal, fast for wood).
4.  **Table:** Can be raised, lowered, and swiveled around the column.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Cast Iron:** For the head, table, and base (rigidity).
  - **Steel:** For the column, spindle, and quill.
  - **Bearings:** Bronze or ball bearings for smooth rotation.
- **Tools:** **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)** (for the spindle), **[Files](/en/inventions/file)**, **[Drill Bit](/en/inventions/drill-bit)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bench Drill:** Smaller, mounts on a workbench.
- **Floor Drill:** Taller column, stands on the floor for larger work.
- **Radial Arm Drill:** The head can move along an arm to drill large plates without moving the workpiece.

## Relationship with Lathe and Mill

The Drill Press, the **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)**, and the **[Milling Machine](/en/inventions/milling-machine)** are essential in any workshop.

- It is the simplest of the three and often the first to be built or acquired.
- The lathe and milling machine can drill, but the drill press is specialized to do so quickly and accurately.
- Drill press parts (like the spindle) are manufactured on a lathe.

## Limits and risks

- **Work Holding:** If the bit grabs the workpiece, it can spin dangerously ("helicoptering"). Always clamp the work.
- **Speed:** Incorrect speed burns bits (too fast on steel) or tears wood (too slow).
- **Hair/Clothing:** Rotating spindle is a major entanglement hazard.
