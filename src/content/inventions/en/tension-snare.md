# Brief description

A tension snare is a trapping system that uses a bent sapling or flexible pole to lift a noose when a trigger is released, tightening around the animal and suspending it to prevent escape.

## Use / Function

- **Game capture:** Secures small to medium animals efficiently.
- **Loss prevention:** Lifts the animal off the ground to reduce chewing and escape.
- **Low-visibility trap:** Works well on trails with minimal hardware.
- **Scale:** Individual or small-group use.

## Operating principle

Stored elastic energy in a bent sapling is held by a trigger. When the animal moves the trigger, the line releases, the sapling snaps upright, and the noose tightens. The upward force keeps the animal off balance and reduces leverage for escape.

## How to create it

1. **Select a spring pole:** Pick a flexible **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** sapling that snaps back without breaking.
2. **Set an anchor:** Tie the spring pole to a stable base or a nearby trunk.
3. **Prepare the line:** Use **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** cordage or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** strips, optionally reinforced with **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** wire.
4. **Build the trigger:** Carve a toggle or peg trigger from wood and test a light release.
5. **Set the noose:** Place the loop at the trail height of the target animal.
6. **Camouflage:** Use light brush to guide the animal into the loop without blocking movement.
7. **Check often:** Reset quickly and minimize suffering.

Technical level: Basic to intermediate carving and cordage skills.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Flexible **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** pole, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** cordage, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** thongs or soft line, optional **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** for wire snare.
- **Tools:** Knife, small hatchet or saw, gloves.
- **Substitutes:** **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** for line, **[Wire](/en/inventions/wire)** for the noose, green vine for quick lashings.

## Variants and improvements

- **Grounded snare:** Shorter lift for dense brush or heavy animals.
- **Tree-mounted snare:** Higher lift to keep the animal off the ground.
- **Sliding lock:** One-way knot or toggle that tightens faster.
- **Multiple snares:** A line of snares along a funnel or fence.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Pets or protected wildlife can be caught.
- **Line failure:** Weak cordage can snap under sudden load.
- **Visibility:** Animals can avoid it if set on open ground.
- **Legal limits:** Many regions regulate or ban snares.
