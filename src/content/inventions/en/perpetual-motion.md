# Brief description

A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical device that can do work indefinitely without an external energy source. While impossible according to the laws of physics, the pursuit of such a machine has driven mechanical innovation for centuries.

## Use / Function

- **Theoretical Goal:** To generate unlimited free energy.
- **Historical Impact:** Led to a deeper understanding of mechanics, friction, and thermodynamics.
- **Educational Tool:** Analyzing why these machines fail is an excellent way to learn physics.

## Operating principle

These machines attempt to violate the laws of thermodynamics:

1.  **First Kind:** Machines that produce more energy than they consume (violates conservation of energy).
2.  **Second Kind:** Machines that spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work without a temperature difference (violates entropy).

Most designs rely on **gravity**, **buoyancy**, or **magnetism** to create an unbalanced force that supposedly keeps the machine moving.

## How to create it (Historical Attempts)

_Note: These designs do not work forever, but they are famous attempts._

### The Overbalanced Wheel (Bhaskara's Wheel)

1.  **Wheel:** A large wheel mounted on an [axle](/en/inventions/axle).
2.  **Arms:** Hinged arms or curved tubes attached to the rim.
3.  **Weights:** Heavy weights (or [mercury](/en/elements/mercury)) that swing out on one side and fold in on the other.
4.  **Concept:** The weights on the descending side are further from the center, creating more torque than the ascending side.
5.  **Reality:** The number of weights on the ascending side is greater, balancing the torque exactly.

### The Magnetic Motor

1.  **Rotor:** A wheel with [magnets](/en/inventions/magnet) angled in one direction.
2.  **Stator:** Fixed magnets arranged to repel the rotor magnets.
3.  **Concept:** The magnetic repulsion pushes the wheel constantly.
4.  **Reality:** The energy gained entering a magnetic field is lost leaving it.

## Materials needed

- **Precision Components:** [Ball and Roller Bearings](/en/inventions/ball-and-roller-bearing) to minimize friction (the main enemy).
- **Weights:** [Lead](/en/materials/lead), [Mercury](/en/elements/mercury), or [Iron](/en/materials/iron).
- **Magnets:** [Magnetite](/en/materials/magnetite) or strong artificial [Magnets](/en/inventions/magnet).

## Variants and improvements

- **Capillary Bowl:** Uses capillary action to lift fluid, hoping it drops back down to drive a wheel (Boyle's Flask).
- **Float Belt:** Buoyant objects rising in water and falling in air.
- **Cox's Timepiece:** A clock powered by changes in atmospheric pressure (technically not perpetual motion, as it draws energy from the environment, but runs "indefinitely").

## Limits and risks

- **Thermodynamics:** The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics make true perpetual motion impossible.
- **Friction:** All moving parts experience friction, which dissipates energy as heat. The machine eventually stops.
- **Fraud:** Many "working" examples throughout history were hoaxes powered by hidden springs or people.
- **Resource Waste:** Endless time and materials can be wasted chasing this impossibility.
