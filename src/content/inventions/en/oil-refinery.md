# Brief description

An oil refinery is a coordinated set of vessels, pipes, and heat systems that separates crude oil into useful fractions at scale. It enables consistent fuels, lubricants, and heavy binders from the same feedstock.

## Use / Function

- **Fuel production**: Produce consistent lamp oils and later fuels.
- **Lubricants**: Separate mid fractions for machinery.
- **Construction binders**: Concentrate heavy fractions for **[Bitumen](/en/materials/bitumen)** and **[Asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt)**.
- **Process safety**: Centralize heat, venting, and cooling.
- **Scale**: Local industrial to regional.

## Operating principle

Refineries are built around controlled heating, vapor routing, and staged condensation.

1. **Preheating**: Crude warms to reduce viscosity and remove water.
2. **Distillation**: Heat separates fractions by boiling range using **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)**.
3. **Condensation**: Vapors cool in **[Pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)** or coils.
4. **Collection**: Each fraction is stored in **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.
5. **Residue handling**: Heavy ends are moved with an **[Oil Pump](/en/inventions/oil-pump)**.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

1. **Still area**: Build a heat-safe still with a sloped condenser.
2. **Cooling line**: Run a coil through a water bath for steady condensation.
3. **Storage**: Provide separate sealed containers for each fraction.
4. **Ventilation**: Add **[Passive Ventilation](/en/inventions/passive-ventilation)** near heat zones.
5. **Transfer**: Use a pump to move heavy residue without overheating.

### Required technological level

Intermediate to advanced. Requires reliable metalwork, sealing, and heat control.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** vessels, **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** or **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** foundations, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** coils or **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** condensers, **[Water](/en/materials/water)** for cooling.
- **Tools**: Cutting tools, hammers, sealants, and temperature control tools.
- **Possible substitutes**: Clay stills for small batches, air-cooled condensers where water is scarce.

## Variants and improvements

- **Batch refinery**: Single still with manual cuts between fractions.
- **Fractional column**: Taller column for better separation.
- **Vacuum distillation**: Lower pressure to reduce cracking of heavy oils.
- **Heat recovery**: Reuse hot output to preheat incoming crude.

## Limits and risks

- **Fire and explosions**: Flammable vapors ignite easily.
- **Toxic fumes**: Venting and distance from living areas are essential.
- **Pressure buildup**: Blocked outlets can rupture vessels.
- **Contamination**: Water or sediment lowers yield and can cause violent boiling.
