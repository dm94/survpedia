# Brief description

A spring is an elastic object that stores mechanical energy. Springs are typically made of spring steel. When a spring is compressed or extended from its resting position, it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length.

## Use / Function

-   **Energy Storage:** Stores potential energy to power mechanisms (e.g., mainspring in **[Mechanical Watches](/en/inventions/mechanical-watch)**).
-   **Regulation:** Provides a restoring force for oscillators (e.g., hairspring in a **[Balance Wheel](/en/inventions/balance-wheel)**).
-   **Shock Absorption:** Absorbs impacts in vehicle suspensions.
-   **Force Measurement:** Measures weight or force in a **[Spring Scale](/en/inventions/spring-scale)**.
-   **Return Mechanism:** Returns keys, levers, or handles to their original position.

## Operating principle

Most springs obey **Hooke's Law**, which states that the force ($F$) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance ($x$) scales linearly with respect to that distance: $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant (stiffness).

1.  **Deformation:** An external force deforms the material within its elastic limit.
2.  **Storage:** The work done to deform the spring is stored as elastic potential energy.
3.  **Release:** When the external force is removed, the spring returns to its original shape, releasing the stored energy.

## How to create it

Creating a durable spring requires precise heat treatment.

1.  **Material Selection:** Use high-carbon steel (**[Spring Steel](/en/materials/spring-steel)**) or work-hardened bronze.
2.  **Forming:** Coil the wire around a mandrel (for coil springs) or flatten and shape it (for leaf springs).
3.  **Hardening:** Heat the steel to its critical temperature (cherry red) and quench it in oil or water. The metal becomes very hard but brittle.
4.  **Tempering:** Reheat the spring to a lower temperature (blue/purple oxide color) to reduce brittleness and impart toughness. This is the critical step for elasticity.

## Materials needed

-   **Essential:** **[Spring Steel](/en/materials/spring-steel)** (high carbon steel).
-   **Substitutes:** Work-hardened **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)** or **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)** (for non-magnetic or corrosion-resistant needs), Wood (bows), Bamboo.
-   **Tools:** Forge, pliers, mandrel, heat source for tempering.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Coil Spring:** A wire wound into a helix (compression or extension).
-   **Leaf Spring:** Flat strips of metal layered together (suspension).
-   **Torsion Spring:** Stores energy by twisting (mousetraps).
-   **Mainspring:** A spiral ribbon of steel used to power timepieces.
-   **Hairspring:** A tiny spiral spring used to regulate a **[Balance Wheel](/en/inventions/balance-wheel)**.
-   **Constant-force Spring:** Exerts a constant force throughout its deflection.

## Limits and risks

-   **Fatigue:** Repeated cycling can cause microscopic cracks, leading to failure over time.
-   **Creep:** Under constant load, a spring may slowly deform permanently (lose tension).
-   **Elastic Limit:** Stretching beyond this point causes permanent deformation.
-   **Safety:** Releasing a spring under high tension can cause injury.
