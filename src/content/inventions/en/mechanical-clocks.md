# Brief description

A broad category of timekeeping devices that use a mechanical oscillator, such as a pendulum or balance wheel, regulated by an escapement mechanism to measure time with high precision. They marked a significant leap from flow-based (water, sand) or observation-based (sun) timekeeping methods.

## Use / Function

- **Precise Timekeeping:** Measuring time with consistent accuracy regardless of weather or daylight.
- **Public Time:** Coordinating community activities through tower clocks.
- **Navigation:** Essential for determining longitude at sea (Chronometers).
- **Scheduling:** Standardizing work hours, transportation, and religious observances.

## Operating principle

All mechanical clocks share four key components:

1.  **Power Source:** Stores potential energy to drive the clock. Usually a suspended weight (constant force) or a coiled spring (mainspring).
2.  **Gear Train:** A series of **[Gears](/en/inventions/gears)** that transmits energy from the power source to the escapement and counts the oscillations to drive the hands.
3.  **Escapement:** The "heart" of the clock. It blocks the gear train and allows it to advance one tooth at a time with each swing of the oscillator. This produces the characteristic "ticking" sound.
4.  **Oscillator:** A physical object that swings back and forth at a constant frequency (isochronism), such as a **[Pendulum](/en/inventions/pendulum-clock)** or a **[Balance Wheel](/en/inventions/balance-wheel)**.

## How to create it

Building a mechanical clock requires precision engineering and an understanding of mechanics.

1.  **Frame:** Construct a sturdy frame (plates and pillars) to hold the moving parts in precise alignment.
2.  **Power System:** Install the drum for the weight cord or the barrel for the mainspring.
3.  **Transmission:** Assemble the gear train. The ratios between gears must be calculated to convert the rapid beats of the escapement into seconds, minutes, and hours.
4.  **Regulation:** Fabricate the escapement wheel and the locking mechanism (verge, anchor, or lever). Connect this to the oscillator.
5.  **Indication:** Attach the hands to the appropriate arbors (shafts) of the gear train.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)** (Brass for gears to reduce friction, Steel for pinions and springs) is preferred. Hard **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** can be used for large tower clocks or rustic movements.
- **Weights:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, or **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**.
- **Lubrication:** Fine **[Oil](/en/materials/oil)** (historically from animal fat or plants) is crucial to prevent wear.

## Variants and improvements

- **Verge and Foliot:** The earliest mechanical escapement, less accurate.
- **Pendulum Clock:** Uses a swinging weight for high accuracy (**[Pendulum Clock](/en/inventions/pendulum-clock)**).
- **Balance Wheel:** Uses a spring-regulated wheel, allowing portability (**[Mechanical Watch](/en/inventions/mechanical-watch)**).
- **Striking Clocks:** Mechanisms that sound bells at specific intervals.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction:** The enemy of precision. Poorly finished parts or lack of oil will stop the clock.
- **Temperature:** Thermal expansion of metal parts can speed up or slow down the clock.
- **Complexity:** Requires specialized tools and high skill to manufacture.
- **Maintenance:** Must be wound regularly and cleaned periodically.
