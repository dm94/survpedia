# Brief description

A curved symmetrical structure spanning an opening and typically supporting the weight of a bridge, roof, or wall above it. It was a revolutionary invention that allowed for larger openings and stronger structures than simple beams.

## Use / Function

-   **Structural Support**: Spans openings for doors, windows, and bridges.
-   **Distribution**: Distributes weight outwards and downwards to the pillars or abutments.
-   **Aesthetics**: Provides a pleasing curved shape.
-   **Scale**: From small doorways to massive aqueducts and domes.

## Operating principle

The arch works by **compression**.
1.  Gravity pulls the weight of the arch and the load above it downwards.
2.  The wedge-shaped stones (voussoirs) push against each other.
3.  This force is transferred outwards along the curve to the supports (abutments).
4.  The **Keystone** at the top locks the entire structure in place.

Because stone and brick are strong in compression but weak in tension, the arch allows them to span large distances without breaking.

## How to create it

1.  **Supports**: Build the side pillars or abutments.
2.  **Centering**: Construct a temporary wooden frame (centering) in the exact shape of the arch. This supports the stones during construction.
3.  **Laying Stones**: Place stones (voussoirs) on the centering, building up from both sides simultaneously.
4.  **Keystone**: Drop the central stone (keystone) into place at the top. This locks the arch.
5.  **Removal**: Carefully remove the wooden centering. The arch should now stand on its own.

## Materials needed

-   **Essential**:
    -   **Stone/Brick**: Shaped into wedges (voussoirs).
    -   **Mortar**: To bind the stones (though dry stone arches are possible).
    -   **Wood**: Critical for the temporary centering frame.
-   **Tools**: Chisels (for shaping stone), saws (for wood), levels.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Round Arch**: The classic semi-circular arch (Roman).
-   **Pointed Arch**: Stronger and taller (Gothic). Allows for less side thrust.
-   **Flat Arch**: Looks like a beam but works like an arch.
-   **Vault**: An arch extended in depth (like a tunnel).
-   **Dome**: An arch rotated 360 degrees.

## Limits and risks

-   **Lateral Thrust**: The arch pushes outwards at the base. If the abutments aren't heavy or buttressed enough, the walls will spread and the arch will collapse.
-   **Asymmetry**: If the load is not balanced, the arch can fail.
-   **Construction Risk**: Removing the centering is the most dangerous moment; if the mortar hasn't set or the geometry is wrong, it collapses immediately.
