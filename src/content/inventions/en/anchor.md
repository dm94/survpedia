An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to connect a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current.

## Use / Function

The primary purpose of an anchor is to hold a ship or boat in a specific location.

- **Mooring:** Keeping a vessel stationary while waiting for a berth, loading/unloading cargo offshore, or resting.
- **Safety:** preventing a ship from being blown onto a lee shore or rocks during a storm.
- **Navigation:** In some historical contexts, used to help turn a ship (kedging).

## Operating principle

Anchors work by resisting the movement of the vessel through two main mechanisms:

1.  **Weight (Gravity):** Simple heavy objects (stones, blocks of concrete) that rely on friction and mass to hold the bottom. Effective for small boats or on hard bottoms.
2.  **Hooking (Shape):** The anchor is designed to dig into the seabed. As the ship pulls, the flukes (points) bury deeper. This is much more efficient than pure weight.

**The Catenary Effect:**
Crucial to anchoring is the "rode" (the rope or chain connecting anchor to ship). A heavy chain forms a curve (catenary). The weight of the chain keeps the pull on the anchor horizontal, which helps it dig in. If the pull is vertical, the anchor breaks out (trips).

## How to create it

### 1. Primitive Anchor (The "Killick")

- **Concept:** A stone trapped in a wooden cage or a forked branch with a stone lashed to it.
- **Materials:** A forked tree branch, a heavy stone, rope/lashings.
- **Method:** Use the fork as the hook, lash the stone for weight.

### 2. Stock Anchor (Admiralty Style)

- **Concept:** A T-shaped iron device. The "stock" (crossbar) ensures the anchor lands flat so one of the two flukes points downward to dig in.
- **Materials:** Wrought iron for shank and arms, wood or iron for the stock.
- **Method:** Forge welding iron bars to form the cross shape. The stock is set at 90 degrees to the arms.

## Materials needed

- **Stone:** The simplest weight.
- **Wood:** For stocks or primitive hook structures.
- **Iron:** For strong, slender shanks and flukes that can penetrate sand/mud.
- **Lead:** Historically used for stocks to add weight in compact form.
- **Rope/Chain:** Essential to connect anchor to ship.

## Variants and improvements

- **Stockless Anchor:** Modern anchors (like the Hall anchor) where the flukes pivot. The stock is removed so the anchor can be pulled up into the hawsepipe of the ship.
- **Mushroom Anchor:** Shaped like a mushroom, used for permanent moorings in soft mud.
- **Danforth/Fluke Anchor:** Lightweight with large flat plates, excellent holding power in sand/mud relative to its weight.

## Limits and risks

- **Dragging:** If the wind/current is too strong, or the bottom is too hard/soft, the anchor may not hold.
- **Fouling:** The rope can get tangled around the anchor sticking up from the bottom, pulling it out.
- **Loss:** If the anchor gets stuck under a rock, the line may need to be cut, losing the anchor.
- **Scope:** You need a line length of 3x to 7x the water depth for the anchor to hold effectively.
