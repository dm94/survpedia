A windcatcher (or *Badgir* in Persian) is a traditional architectural element used to create natural ventilation in buildings. It is essentially a tall chimney with openings at the top, designed to "catch" the wind and direct it inwards, or to suction hot air outwards.

## Use / Function

Its function is to cool interior spaces in hot climates, especially in desert areas.

- **Primary Use**: Ventilation and cooling of homes and water cisterns.
- **Scale**: Architectural (integrated into the building).

## Operating Principle

The windcatcher can work in three ways, often simultaneously:

1.  **Wind Catching (Positive Pressure)**: Openings facing the prevailing wind "catch" the air and force it down the duct into the rooms, displacing stale air.
2.  **Suction Effect (Negative Pressure)**: If the wind blows over an opening not facing it, low pressure (Venturi effect) is created, suctioning hot air from inside to outside.
3.  **Stack Effect**: Even without wind, hot air inside tends to rise up the tower and escape, creating a draft of fresh air entering through lower windows.

## How to Create It

### Basic Structure
It is a masonry tower (brick, adobe, or stone) rising above the building's roof.

- **Ducts**: The tower interior is usually divided vertically into several ducts (commonly 4 or 8) by partitions. This allows the tower to function independently of wind direction (one side catches wind while the opposite extracts air).
- **Openings**: Long windows at the top.

### Technical Level Required
- **Intermediate/Advanced**: Requires masonry skills and understanding of local prevailing winds.

## Materials Needed

- **Brick or Adobe**: Ideal materials for their thermal mass. They heat up slowly during the day and release heat at night.
- **Wood**: To reinforce the structure and create internal partitions or support beams.
- **Mortar**: To bind the bricks.

## Variants and Improvements

- **Unidirectional Badgir**: Has a single opening facing the prevailing wind (common in areas with constant winds).
- **Multidirectional Badgir**: Has openings on all 4 sides to catch winds from any direction.
- **Combination with Water (Qanat)**: Often, the windcatcher leads air over an underground water channel or an indoor fountain. The dry air evaporates some of the water, cooling drastically and increasing humidity, providing superior thermal comfort.

## Limits and Risks

- **Dust and Sand**: In sandstorms, the tower can introduce dust into the house. Traditional versions have wooden doors or dampers to close them in these cases.
- **Heat Loss in Winter**: If they cannot be sealed tightly, they will cool the house excessively in winter.
- **Animals**: Needs grilles to prevent the entry of birds or insects.
