# Brief description

A watermill is a structure that uses a [water wheel](/en/inventions/water-wheel) or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are innovative for agriculture and manufacturing.

## Use / Function

- **Milling:** Grinding grain into flour.
- **Sawing:** Powering large saws to cut lumber.
- **Fulling:** Pounding woolen cloth to clean and thicken it.
- **Metalworking:** Powering bellows and trip hammers in forges.
- **Scale:** Industrial/Local.

## Operating principle

The mill harnesses the kinetic energy of flowing or falling water.
1. **Flow:** Water is directed onto the blades or buckets of a [water wheel](/en/inventions/water-wheel).
2. **Rotation:** The force of the water causes the wheel to rotate.
3. **Transmission:** The rotating shaft of the water wheel is connected to gears that change the direction or speed of rotation.
4. **Work:** The final gear or shaft drives the machinery (e.g., rotating the upper millstone).

## How to create it

1.  **Site selection:** Find a source of flowing water with sufficient volume and drop (head).
2.  **Water Wheel construction:** Build a wheel with paddles (undershot) or buckets (overshot) made of durable wood or metal.
3.  **Sluice/Millrace:** Construct a channel to direct water from the source to the wheel.
4.  **Drivetrain:** Install a main shaft connected to the wheel and use bevel gears to transfer power to the vertical shaft of the mill.
5.  **Millstones:** Set up the fixed bedstone and the rotating runner stone.
6.  **Control mechanism:** Install a sluice gate to control the water flow and stop the mill.

## Materials needed

- **Water wheel and structure:** Strong, water-resistant wood (like oak) or iron.
- **Millstones:** Hard, abrasive stone (granite, basalt).
- **Shafts and Gears:** Iron or hardwood.
- **Lubricant:** Animal fat or grease for the bearings.
- **Binding:** Nails, bolts, and metal bands.

## Variants and improvements

- **Undershot wheel:** Placed in a fast-flowing stream; water passes underneath. Simple but less efficient.
- **Overshot wheel:** Water is fed from the top into buckets. Much more efficient but requires a significant drop in height.
- **Breastshot wheel:** Water enters at the middle of the wheel.
- **Water Turbine:** Modern, high-efficiency version used for electricity generation.

## Limits and risks

- **Water Dependency:** Seasonal changes (drought or freezing) can stop the mill.
- **Flooding:** High water levels can damage the structure.
- **Maintenance:** Constant exposure to water causes wood to rot and iron to rust. Millstones need regular dressing.
- **Safety:** High torque machinery can be extremely dangerous if contacted during operation.
