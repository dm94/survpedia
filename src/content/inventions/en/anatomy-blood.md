# Brief description

Anatomy & Blood is a practical field knowledge set that maps the body’s main structures and explains how blood moves, how it is lost, and how to protect it during care.

## Use / Function

- **Orientation**: Identify bones, muscles, and surface landmarks for safer handling.
- **Circulation awareness**: Locate major arteries and veins to avoid or control bleeding.
- **Procedure guidance**: Support careful use of **[Surgery Tools](/en/inventions/surgery-tools)** and **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)** work.
- **Bleeding control**: Apply pressure, packing, and elevation in a structured way.
- **Scale**: Individual care to small-group field medicine.

## Operating principle

- **Layered structure**: Skin, fascia, muscle, and bone create predictable paths and barriers.
- **Flow and pressure**: Arteries pulse out, veins return blood; pressure determines bleeding speed.
- **Clotting**: Clean, stable contact and compression help blood coagulate and seal vessels.
- **Shock limits**: Blood volume loss rapidly reduces oxygen delivery and consciousness.

## How to create it

1. **Map landmarks**: Use **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** references and palpation to mark joints, ribs, and major bony points.
2. **Trace circulation**: Identify primary arteries and veins, then mark safe zones for pressure and bandaging.
3. **Build a reference**: Draw diagrams on **[Paper](/en/materials/paper)** with **[Ink](/en/materials/ink)** or etch on wood or leather for durability.
4. **Validate with anatomy**: Compare human landmarks to animal anatomy for practice and refinement.
5. **Field test**: Use real scenarios to refine notes and update procedures.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: **[Paper](/en/materials/paper)**, **[Ink](/en/materials/ink)**, **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** references, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** tools for precise work.
- **Hygiene**: **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
- **Tools**: Measuring cord, fine points, **[Scalpel](/en/inventions/scalpel)**, **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)**.
- **Possible substitutes**: Charcoal for ink, bark for paper, carved wood models instead of bone.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pocket cards**: Essential landmarks and bleeding control steps.
- **Layered charts**: Transparent sheets to separate skin, muscle, and vessel maps.
- **Color coding**: Red for arteries, blue for veins, black for nerves.
- **Expanded atlas**: Regional anatomy for head, chest, abdomen, and limbs.

## Limits and risks

- **Misidentification**: Wrong landmarks can damage nerves or arteries.
- **False confidence**: Knowledge does not replace training or experience.
- **Infection**: Poor hygiene during practice causes contamination.
- **Ethics**: Avoid harm when practicing; use animal remains or diagrams instead of live subjects.
