# Brief description

A barrier constructed to hold back water and raise its level, forming a reservoir used for water storage, irrigation, or electricity generation.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Creating a reservoir for **[Water Supply](/en/inventions/water-supply)** during dry seasons.
- **Secondary uses:** Flood control, hydroelectric power, irrigation, recreation.
- **Scale:** Small (farm pond) to massive (Hoover Dam).

## Operating principle

- **Hydrostatic Pressure:** The dam wall resists the immense pressure of the water behind it.
- **Gravity:** The weight of the dam itself anchors it against the water's push (Gravity Dam).
- **Arch Action:** The curved shape transfers water pressure to the canyon walls (Arch Dam).

## How to create it

1.  **Site Selection:** Narrow valley with solid bedrock foundation.
2.  **Diversion:** Temporarily divert the river (tunnels or channels) to work on a dry riverbed.
3.  **Foundation:** Excavate loose soil down to solid rock. Grout cracks to prevent seepage under the dam.
4.  **Construction:** Build the wall using **[concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[stone](/en/materials/stone)** masonry, or compacted **[earth](/en/materials/earth)**.
5.  **Spillway:** Include a channel to safely release excess water during floods to prevent overtopping.

## Materials needed

- **Structure:** **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Earth](/en/materials/earth)** (clay core), **[Timber](/en/materials/wood)** (small dams).
- **Waterproofing:** Clay core, **[concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** face.
- **Tools:** **[Excavators](/en/inventions/excavator)** (or **[shovels](/en/inventions/shovel)**), **[cranes](/en/inventions/crane)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Earthfill Dam:** Embankment of compacted soil with a clay core. Cheapest, suitable for broad valleys.
- **Gravity Dam:** Massive concrete/stone wall. Requires strong foundation.
- **Arch Dam:** Thin, curved concrete wall. Requires strong canyon walls.
- **Beaver Dam:** Natural example using wood and mud.

## Limits and risks

- **Failure:** Catastrophic flooding downstream if the dam breaks.
- **Siltation:** Sediment builds up behind the dam, reducing capacity over time.
- **Ecosystem:** Blocks fish migration and alters river ecology.
- **Seepage:** Water leaking under the dam can erode the foundation (piping).
