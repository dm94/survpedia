# Brief description

A navigational instrument that shows the cardinal directions used for navigation and geographic orientation. It typically consists of a magnetized needle or other element, such as a compass card or compass rose, which can pivot to align itself with magnetic north.

## Use / Function

- **Navigation**: Determining direction of travel.
- **Orientation**: Aligning maps with the terrain.
- **Surveying**: Measuring horizontal angles for mapping.

## Operating principle

**Magnetism**: The Earth acts like a giant magnet with magnetic poles near the geographic poles. A magnetized object (like a needle) that is free to rotate will align itself with the Earth's magnetic field lines, pointing roughly North-South.

## How to create it

### Wet Compass (Simplest)

1.  **Magnetize a Needle**: Rub a steel needle (or a straightened paperclip/wire) with a magnet or lodestone. Rub in **one direction only** (e.g., from eye to point), lifting the magnet at the end of each stroke. Do this 50-100 times.
2.  **Float**: Place the needle on a small piece of cork, a leaf, or a piece of paper floating in a bowl of still water.
3.  **Read**: The needle will rotate to align with the North-South line. You need to know which way is North (using the sun or stars) initially to mark the "North" end of your needle.

### Dry Compass

1.  **Pivot**: Push a pin vertically through a base (wood/cork).
2.  **Balance**: Balance the magnetized needle horizontally on the tip of the pin. A small indentation or a glass bead in the center of the needle helps reduce friction.
3.  **Housing**: Enclose in a box to protect from wind.

## Materials needed

- **Ferrous Metal**: A needle, wire, or thin strip of steel/iron.
- **Magnetizer**: Lodestone (Magnetite) or an existing magnet. (Alternatively, electricity and a coil).
- **Float/Pivot**: Cork, leaf, or a sharp pin.
- **Container**: Bowl of water or a box.

## Variants and improvements

- **Lodestone Compass**: An early Chinese version using a spoon-shaped lodestone on a bronze plate.
- **Mariner's Compass**: Uses a gimbal (pivoting support) to keep the compass level on a rocking ship.
- **Liquid-filled Compass**: The housing is filled with liquid (oil/alcohol) to dampen the needle's movement, making it stable.

## Limits and risks

- **Magnetic Declination**: Magnetic North is not exactly True North. The difference varies by location and changes over time.
- **Interference**: Nearby iron objects (tools, weapons, ores) or electronic devices will deflect the needle (Deviation).
- **Dip**: Near the poles, the magnetic field lines point downwards, causing the needle to dip and potentially drag or get stuck.
