# Brief description

A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky.

## Use / Function

- **Timekeeping:** Indicating the time of day.
- **Navigation:** Determining latitude and direction (North/South).
- **Decoration:** Garden ornament.

## Operating principle

As the sun moves across the sky, it casts a shadow from a **gnomon** (a thin rod or sharp edge) onto a flat plate (the **dial**). The position of the shadow indicates the time.

- **Gnomon Alignment:** Must be parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation (pointing to the celestial pole).

## How to create it

1.  **Base:** Create a flat surface (horizontal, vertical, or inclined).
2.  **Gnomon:** Install a rod at an angle equal to the local latitude.
3.  **Alignment:** Orient the gnomon to point True North (in Northern Hemisphere) or True South (in Southern Hemisphere).
4.  **Marking:** Mark the shadow position at each hour using a reliable clock or by geometry.

- **Technical level:** Intermediate (requires astronomical knowledge).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Stone or metal for durability outdoors.
- **Tools:** Compass, level, protractor.

## Variants and improvements

- **Horizontal dial:** The most common garden type.
- **Vertical dial:** Mounted on walls.
- **Equatorial dial:** The dial plate is parallel to the equator.
- **Analemmatic dial:** The gnomon is vertical and moved depending on the date.

## Limits and risks

- **Night/Cloud:** Only works when the sun is shining.
- **Equation of Time:** Solar time varies from clock time throughout the year (up to ~16 mins).
- **Latitude:** A fixed dial only works accurately at the latitude it was designed for.
