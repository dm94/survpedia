# Brief description
A device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky.

## Use / Function
- **Timekeeping**: Knowing the time of day.
- **Navigation**: Finding true North (at noon).

## Operating principle
As the sun moves across the sky, it casts a shadow. A stick (gnomon) casts a shadow onto a flat surface (dial plate). The angle of the shadow changes with the sun's position.

## How to create it
1.  **Gnomon**: Stick a rod into the ground.
2.  **Calibration**:
    -   Mark the shadow tip at sunrise and sunset.
    -   Find the shortest shadow of the day; this is local noon (North/South line).
    -   Divide the arc between sunrise and noon into roughly equal hours.

## Materials needed
-   Stick (Gnomon)
-   Flat surface (Ground, Stone, Wood)

## Variants and improvements
-   **Inclined Gnomon**: Pointing the gnomon towards the celestial pole (parallel to Earth's axis) makes the hour lines consistent throughout the year.
-   **Portable Sundial**: A pocket version adjusted for latitude.
