# Brief description

A device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky.

## Use / Function

- **Timekeeping:** Telling the time of day.
- **Navigation:** Finding True North (at local noon).

## Operating principle

As the sun moves across the sky, it casts a shadow. A stick (gnomon) casts a shadow on a flat surface (dial). The angle of the shadow changes with the sun's position.

## How to create it

1.  **Gnomon:** Drive a rod into the ground.
2.  **Calibration:**
    - Mark the tip of the shadow at sunrise and sunset.
    - Find the shortest shadow of the day; this is local noon (North/South line).
    - Divide the arc between sunrise and noon into roughly equal hours.

## Materials needed

- Stick (Gnomon)
- Flat surface (Ground, Stone, Wood)

## Variants and improvements

- **Tilted Gnomon:** Pointing the gnomon towards the celestial pole (parallel to Earth's axis) makes the hour lines consistent throughout the year.
- **Portable Sundial:** A pocket version adjusted for latitude.
