# Brief description

X-ray imaging produces invisible, high-energy light to see inside objects. It reveals dense structures like bone or metal by how much they block the beam.

## Use / Function

- **Medical imaging:** Bones, lungs, teeth, and foreign objects.
- **Non-destructive testing:** Cracks in metal parts, welds, and castings.
- **Security screening:** Hidden objects inside luggage or containers.
- **Alignment and inspection:** Checking assembly fit without disassembly.

## Operating principle

An X-ray tube is a specialized **[Vacuum Tube](/en/inventions/vacuum-tube)**:

1. **Cathode heating:** A tungsten filament emits electrons.
2. **Acceleration:** A high voltage pulls electrons across a vacuum.
3. **Target impact:** Electrons hit a tungsten target and release X-rays.
4. **Beam shaping:** A window and collimator narrow the beam.
5. **Image capture:** A detector or film records the shadow image.

Dense materials absorb more X-rays, so they appear lighter on the image.

## How to create it

1. **Build the tube:** Seal a glass envelope with a tungsten cathode and target.
2. **Create vacuum:** Evacuate the tube and seal it airtight.
3. **High-voltage supply:** Provide stable, high voltage to accelerate electrons.
4. **Shielding and housing:** Mount the tube in a lead-lined enclosure.
5. **Detector setup:** Use film or a digital sensor to capture the image.

Minimum functional version: a sealed tube, basic high-voltage supply, and film detector. Technical level required is advanced due to high voltage, vacuum work, and radiation safety.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** for the tube, **[Tungsten](/en/materials/tungsten)** for filament/target, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** for conductors.
- **Shielding:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** to block stray radiation.
- **Structure:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for the housing and mounts.
- **Tools:** Vacuum pump, high-voltage insulation, and precision alignment tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Rotating anode:** Spreads heat for higher power output.
- **Microfocus tubes:** Sharper images for small parts.
- **Digital detectors:** Faster capture with less dose.
- **Portable units:** Battery-powered field imaging.

## Limits and risks

- **Radiation exposure:** Requires strict shielding and time limits.
- **High voltage:** Electrical hazard during operation and maintenance.
- **Heat load:** Targets overheat without cooling.
- **Resolution limits:** Scatter and motion blur reduce detail.
