# Brief description

An alembic is an alchemical still consisting of two vessels connected by a tube, used for distilling chemicals, medicines, perfumes, and food products. It is the grandfather of modern distillation apparatus.

It allows you to perform distillation efficiently by channeling vapor from a heated pot to a cooling vessel.

## Use / Function

Its primary practical purpose is controlled distillation:

- **Production of Spirits**: Brandy, whiskey, etc.
- **Essential Oils**: Extracting scents and medicinal compounds.
- **Alchemy/Chemistry**: Purifying acids and other chemicals.

## Operating principle

It directs rising vapor into a downward sloping tube for collection.

1.  **Cucurbit (Pot)**: Contains the liquid to be distilled; heated from below.
2.  **Anbik (Head/Helm)**: Covers the pot. It catches the rising vapor, which cools slightly on the head's walls and channels into the spout.
3.  **Solen (Tube/Beak)**: Transports the vapor/liquid to the receiver.
4.  **Receiver**: Collects the distillate.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Improvised)

1.  **Pot**: Any fire-safe pot.
2.  **Lid**: An inverted cone or bowl placed on top.
3.  **Catch**: A smaller bowl floating inside the pot or suspended to catch drips from the inverted lid (if cooling is applied to top of lid).
4.  **External**: Ideally, a tube leads out from the lid to a cooling coil.

### Classic Copper Alembic

1.  **Forming**: Hammer copper sheets into a pot shape and a bulbous head with a swan-neck spout.
2.  **Joining**: Rivet and solder (lead-free!) the seams.
3.  **Condenser**: Connect the spout to a worm (coil) submerged in a barrel of cold water.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **Copper**: Traditional and best. It removes sulfur tastes from alcohol and conducts heat well.
  - **Clay/Ceramics**: Historical alternative, harder to seal and heat control is slower.
  - **Glass**: Good for laboratory and seeing the process, but fragile.
- **Tools**:
  - **Hammer/Anvil**: For shaping metal.
  - **Kiln**: For firing clay.

## Variants and improvements

- **Retort**: A single glass vessel with a long downward neck (simpler, for small batches).
- **Pot Still**: The modern large-scale version of the alembic.
- **Reflux Still**: Adds a column to the alembic for higher purity in one run.

## Limits and risks

- **Sealing**: Leaks mean lost product and danger of fire/explosion (alcohol vapor is explosive).
- **Corrosion**: Acidic washes can corrode copper; it needs cleaning.
- **Pressure**: Ensure the outlet is never blocked.
