# Brief description

A hose is a flexible hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another. Unlike pipes, hoses are flexible and can be easily moved or coiled.

## Use / Function

- **Transport:** Moving water, fuels, or gases.
- **Gardening/Agriculture:** Watering plants (garden hose).
- **Firefighting:** Delivering high-pressure water (fire hose).
- **Diving:** Supplying air to divers.
- **Hydraulics:** Transmitting power in machinery.

## Operating principle

Hoses operate on the same principle as pipes, containing fluid pressure. Their flexibility comes from the materials used and their reinforcement structure (braiding).

## How to create it

1.  **Extrusion:** For plastic or rubber hoses, the material is pushed through a die to form a tube.
2.  **Reinforcement:** A layer of braided fiber (nylon, wire) is wrapped around the inner tube.
3.  **Coating:** An outer layer is applied for protection.
4.  **Traditional:** Sewing strips of leather or canvas into a tube (early fire hoses).

## Materials needed

- **Inner tube:** [Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber), [Plastic](/en/materials/plastic) (PVC, Polyurethane).
- **Reinforcement:** [String](/en/materials/string), wire, or fabric mesh.
- **Connectors:** [Metal](/en/materials/metal) or plastic fittings at the ends.

## Variants and improvements

- **Garden Hose:** Standard PVC or rubber for water.
- **Fire Hose:** Canvas or synthetic fabric, collapsible and high-pressure resistant.
- **Hydraulic Hose:** Reinforced with steel wire for very high pressures.
- **Soaker Hose:** Porous material to let water seep out slowly.

## Limits and risks

- **Kinking:** Sharp bends can block flow.
- **Bursting:** Exceeding pressure limits.
- **Degradation:** UV light and chemicals can crack the material.
