# Brief description

A simple electric generator is a DIY device that converts mechanical energy into electricity using basic materials like copper wire and magnets. It demonstrates the fundamental principles of electromagnetic induction in a functional, survival-oriented package.

## Use / Function

- **Small-scale Power:** Generating enough electricity to power small LED lights or charge simple batteries.
- **Educational:** Demonstrating how electricity works.
- **Emergency Signal:** Powering a small light for signaling.

## Operating principle

It operates on Faraday's Law of Induction. When a magnetic field (from rotating magnets) passes across a conductor (coils of copper wire), it induces an electron flow (current) in the wire. The mechanical rotation changes the magnetic flux through the coils, creating electricity.

## How to create it

1.  **Prepare the Stator:** Create two large coils of insulated copper wire (hundreds of turns each) and mount them on a stationary wooden frame, facing each other with a small gap.
2.  **Prepare the Rotor:** Mount strong magnets (or lodestones if processed) on a shaft that can spin. The magnets should be arranged so that their poles (N/S) alternate.
3.  **Assembly:** Place the rotor between or near the stator coils. Ensure the magnets pass very close to the coils without touching them.
4.  **Drive Mechanism:** Attach a hand crank or a small pulley system to the rotor shaft to spin it rapidly.
5.  **Output:** Connect the ends of the coil wires to your load (e.g., an LED).

## Materials needed

- **Insulated Copper Wire:** Thin, enamel-coated wire works best for coils (magnet wire).
- **Magnets:** Strong permanent magnets (salvaged or naturally occurring lodestones, though lodestones are very weak).
- **Shaft:** A straight metal or wooden rod (e.g., a large nail or dowel).
- **Frame:** Wood or scrap material to hold everything in place.
- **Cardboard/Paper:** To make the spool for the wire coils.

## Variants and improvements

- **Multi-pole Rotor:** Using more magnets increases the frequency and smoothness of the output.
- **Iron Core:** Wrapping the wire around an iron core (like a bolt) significantly increases the magnetic field concentration and power output (though it creates "cogging").
- **Rectifier:** Adding a diode (if available) converts the AC output to DC for charging batteries.

## Limits and risks

- **Low Power:** A simple hand-built generator produces very low voltage and current, likely only enough for an LED, not heavy tools.
- **Inconsistent Output:** The voltage fluctuates with the speed of rotation.
- **Wear:** Homemade bearings (wood/metal) wear out quickly under high speed.
