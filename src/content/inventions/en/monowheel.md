# Brief description

A monowheel is a one-wheeled vehicle similar to a unicycle, but instead of sitting above the wheel, the rider sits either inside the wheel or next to it. The wheel is a large ring, usually several feet in diameter, and the rider remains upright while the wheel rotates around them.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** Personal transport over various terrains.
- **Recreation:** Used for entertainment and racing due to its unique riding dynamics.
- **Military:** Historically experimented with for single-soldier transport or armored variants.

## Operating principle

The monowheel relies heavily on the **gyroscopic effect** and the **flywheel effect** for stability.

- **Stability:** As the large wheel spins, it acts as a massive [flywheel](/en/inventions/flywheel), resisting tipping over.
- **Propulsion:** The engine or pedals drive a smaller wheel or gear that presses against the inner rim of the large wheel.
- **Steering:** Accomplished by the rider shifting their weight (leaning) or, in more complex models, using aerodynamic rudders or shifting the inner frame's center of gravity.

## How to create it

### Basic Mechanical Structure

1.  **Outer Ring:** A large, rigid circular track (often made of [Steel](/en/materials/steel) or [Iron](/en/materials/iron)) that makes contact with the ground. It may have a rubber tire.
2.  **Inner Ring/Frame:** A slightly smaller ring or frame that fits inside the outer ring. This frame holds the rider's seat, engine/pedals, and controls.
3.  **Bearing System:** The critical component. The inner frame rides on rollers or **[Ball and Roller Bearings](/en/inventions/ball-and-roller-bearing)** that run along the inside track of the outer ring. This allows the outer ring to spin while the inner frame remains stationary relative to the ground.
4.  **Drive Mechanism:** A friction wheel or gear driven by the engine/pedals that engages with the outer ring to force it to rotate.

### Technical level

Advanced. Requires precise bending of large metal tubes and a complex bearing system to reduce friction and maintain alignment.

## Materials needed

- **Frame:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** tubing.
- **Tire:** **[Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)** or solid rubber for traction.
- **Bearings:** High-quality **[Ball and Roller Bearings](/en/inventions/ball-and-roller-bearing)** or custom rollers.
- **Seat:** **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** or padded seat.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pedal-powered:** Driven by human power, similar to a bicycle. Hard to achieve high speeds needed for stability.
- **Motorized:** Uses a gasoline engine or electric motor.
- **Armored:** Historical concepts ("War Tank") where the rider is protected inside a solid shell.

## Limits and risks

- **"Gerbiling" (Hamster Effect):** If the rider accelerates or brakes too hard, the force can cause the inner frame (and rider) to spin inside the wheel instead of moving the vehicle forward. This acts like a pendulum.
- **Vision:** The wheel itself can obstruct the rider's forward view.
- **Steering:** Very difficult to steer compared to a bicycle; turning radius is usually large.
- **Braking:** Sudden braking causes the rider to spin forward (gerbiling).
