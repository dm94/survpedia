# Brief description

The fire saw is a friction method where a thin stick is sawed back and forth across a groove in a softer board to produce a hot dust pile and ember.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Generate an ember for fire starting.
- **Secondary uses:** Works well in dry environments with light materials.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

Sawing motion creates concentrated friction heat along a narrow contact line. The dust collects at the end of the groove and ignites into an ember.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare the board:** Soft, dry wood with a shallow groove.
2. **Prepare the saw stick:** Thin, straight, and harder wood.
3. **Saw:** Move the stick rapidly in a back-and-forth motion.
4. **Ember:** Allow dust to gather and glow, then transfer to tinder.
5. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Softwood board, thin saw stick, tinder bundle.
- **Tools:** Knife or sharp stone to shape the groove.
- **Substitutes:** Fire plow if a saw stick is unavailable.

## Variants and improvements

- **Two-stick saw:** Two thin sticks for more surface contact.
- **Notched end:** Helps collect dust faster.
- **Prepared tinder:** Use finely shredded fibers for easier ignition.

## Limits and risks

- **Material sensitive:** Requires very dry wood.
- **Hand fatigue:** Fast motion tires quickly.
- **Dust loss:** Wind can blow away hot dust before it ignites.
