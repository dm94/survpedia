# Brief description

A gripping tool consisting of two pivoted limbs, used to hold and manipulate objects that are too hot, heavy, or dangerous to touch by hand. Essential for blacksmithing.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is **safety and manipulation**.

- **Holding Hot Metal**: Gripping red-hot iron securely on the anvil while hammering.
- **Placement**: Moving items into and out of the forge fire.
- **Quenching**: Dipping hot steel into water or oil without burning fingers.

## Operating principle

The tongs rely on the **Class 1 Lever** principle.

- **Fulcrum**: The rivet or pivot point.
- **Effort**: The hand squeezing the long handles (reins).
- **Load**: The pressure applied by the short jaws (bits) on the workpiece.
- **Advantage**: Long handles provide leverage to grip tightly with less hand strength, and distance to keep the user safe from heat.

## How to create it

### Forging Tongs

1.  **Stock**: Start with two steel bars (e.g., rebar or square stock).
2.  **Jaws**: Flatten and shape one end of each bar to form the gripping surface (bit).
3.  **Boss**: Upset (thicken) and flatten the area behind the jaw to create a flat spot for the pivot. Punch or drill a hole here.
4.  **Reins**: Draw out (thin and lengthen) the rest of the bar to form the handles.
5.  **Assembly**: Place the two halves together (crossing them) and insert a rivet (metal pin) through the holes. Hammer the rivet heads flat while hot to lock them, but leave it loose enough to move.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **Metal**: **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Mild Steel](/en/materials/steel)**. High carbon steel is not necessary and can be brittle if cooled rapidly in water during use.
- **Tools**: **[Forge](/en/inventions/forge)**, **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**, **[Anvil](/en/inventions/anvil)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Flat Tongs**: Flat jaws for holding flat metal sheets or bars.
- **Wolf Jaw Tongs**: V-notched jaws for holding round or square stock securely.
- **Bolt Tongs**: Curved jaws with a gap behind them to allow holding bolts by the head without the shank interfering.
- **Pick-up Tongs**: Simple shape for picking up dropped tools or coal.

## Limits and risks

- **Specific Fit**: Tongs must be sized to the workpiece. Using the wrong size tongs is dangerous as the hot metal can fly out when struck. A smith usually makes many pairs for different sizes.
- **Heat Transfer**: If left in the fire, the handles can get hot.
- Slip: If the grip is loose, the metal can rotate or slip under the hammer blow.
