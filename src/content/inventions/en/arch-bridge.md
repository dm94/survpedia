# Brief description

An **Arch Bridge** is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. It works by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. It is one of the oldest and strongest types of bridges, capable of standing for thousands of years.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation**: To allow passage over obstacles like rivers, valleys, or roads.
- **Durability**: Stone arch bridges are incredibly durable and low maintenance compared to wood or iron bridges.
- **Load Bearing**: Excellent for carrying heavy loads due to its compressive strength.
- **Aesthetics**: Often considered aesthetically pleasing due to the natural curve.

## Operating principle

The arch bridge works primarily by **compression**.

1.  **Load Transfer**: The weight of the bridge and the traffic on it pushes downwards.
2.  **Compression Path**: The arch shape directs this force outwards and downwards along the curve of the arch.
3.  **Abutments**: The force arrives at the supports (abutments) at the ends of the bridge. These abutments push back against the arch, preventing the ends from spreading apart.
4.  **Keystone**: The central stone at the top of the arch locks the voussoirs (wedge-shaped stones) together, ensuring the structure remains stable under compression.

Unlike beam bridges which experience tension on the bottom, a well-designed masonry arch is almost entirely in compression, which suits materials like **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** and **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** perfectly.

## How to create it

1.  **Foundations**: Excavate and build solid foundations for the abutments on both sides of the gap. These must be immovable to resist the outward thrust.
2.  **Abutments**: Construct the massive supports at the ends.
3.  **Centering**: Build a temporary wooden framework (centering) that mimics the shape of the intended arch. This supports the weight of the stones until the arch is complete.
4.  **Arch Ring**: Lay the wedge-shaped stones (voussoirs) or bricks on the centering, working from both sides towards the center simultaneously to keep the load balanced.
5.  **Keystone**: Place the final stone (keystone) at the top center. This key piece locks the arch into compression.
6.  **Spandrels & Deck**: Fill the space above the arch (spandrels) with rubble or masonry to create a flat surface, then pave the deck.
7.  **Removal**: Carefully lower and remove the wooden centering. The arch settles slightly and supports itself.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**: Strong in compression, shaped into wedges.
  - **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**: To bind the masonry and distribute pressure evenly (though dry stone is possible).
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: Absolutely critical for the temporary centering structure.
  - **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**: For modern arch bridges.
  - **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**: For modern through-arch bridges or reinforcement.
- **Tools**: **[Chisel](/en/inventions/chisel)**, **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**, **[Level](/en/inventions/level)**, hoists or cranes.

## Variants and improvements

- **Roman Arch**: Semicircular arches. Strong but require tall abutments relative to the span.
- **Segmental Arch**: An arch that is less than a semicircle (flatter). Allows for longer spans with lower rise, but exerts more horizontal thrust.
- **Pointed Arch**: Gothic style, directs forces more vertically, reducing side thrust.
- **Multiple Arches**: A series of arches supported by intermediate piers (viaducts).
- **Through Arch Bridge**: The deck passes through the arch (often steel), with the deck hanging from the arch above.

## Limits and risks

- **Span Limit**: Stone arches have a limit to how wide they can span before their own weight causes them to collapse.
- **Abutment Failure**: If the ground moves or the abutments slide, the arch loses compression and collapses instantly.
- **Construction Danger**: The structure is unstable until the keystone is placed. Failure of the centering during construction is catastrophic.
- **Rigidity**: Masonry arches do not handle earthquakes or ground settling well; they can crack and fail.
