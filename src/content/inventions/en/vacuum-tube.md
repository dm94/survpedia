# Brief description

A vacuum tube (or valve) is an electronic device that controls the flow of electric current in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied. It was the key component of early electronics (radio, TV, computers).

## Use / Function

- **Amplification:** Increases the power of a weak signal (audio, radio).
- **Switching:** Acts as a fast on/off switch for digital logic (early computers).
- **Rectification:** Converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).
- **Oscillation:** Generates radio frequency signals.

## Operating principle

It relies on **thermionic emission**:

1.  **Cathode:** A filament (tungsten) is heated until it emits electrons.
2.  **Vacuum:** The glass envelope is evacuated so air molecules don't obstruct the electrons.
3.  **Anode (Plate):** A positively charged plate attracts the electrons, creating a current flow.
4.  **Grid:** A mesh placed between the cathode and anode controls the flow. A small voltage change on the grid causes a large change in current at the anode (amplification).

## How to create it

1.  **Envelope:** Blow a glass bulb.
2.  **Electrodes:** Fabricate the cathode (filament), grid (fine wire), and anode (plate) from metal.
3.  **Assembly:** Mount the electrodes on a stem, ensuring they don't touch.
4.  **Sealing:** Insert the assembly into the bulb and seal the glass.
5.  **Evacuation:** Use a vacuum pump to remove air through a small tube, then seal it off. A "getter" (reactive metal) is often flashed inside to absorb remaining gas.

## Materials needed

- **Glass:** For the airtight envelope.
- **Tungsten:** For the heater filament (high melting point).
- **Metals:** Nickel or steel for the plate and grid; Copper for leads.
- **Vacuum:** Not a material, but an essential condition.

## Variants and improvements

- **Diode:** Two electrodes (rectification).
- **Triode:** Three electrodes (amplification - the breakthrough).
- **Pentode:** Five electrodes (better efficiency and stability).
- **Miniaturization:** Smaller tubes for portable radios before transistors.

## Limits and risks

- **Heat:** They get very hot and waste energy.
- **Fragility:** Glass can break easily.
- **Voltage:** Require high voltages to operate.
- **Lifespan:** Filaments eventually burn out.
