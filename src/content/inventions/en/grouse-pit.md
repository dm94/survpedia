# Brief description

A grouse pit is a shallow, covered pit trap designed for ground birds. It uses a camouflaged lid and guiding wings to encourage birds to step onto a weak cover and drop into the pit.

## Use / Function

- **Food capture:** Collects ground birds such as grouse or partridge.
- **Low hardware:** Relies on digging and camouflage rather than springs or metal.
- **Quiet operation:** No loud snap or moving parts.
- **Scale:** Individual or small-group use.

## Operating principle

A shallow pit is dug and lightly covered. Guide wings of brush or low fences funnel birds toward the cover. When a bird steps onto the weak lid, it gives way and the bird drops into the pit. Smooth walls and a light overhead cover reduce escape.

## How to create it

1. **Select a route:** Find a feeding path or dusting area used by ground birds.
2. **Dig the pit:** Use a **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)** to make a shallow hole with smooth sides.
3. **Shape the lid:** Lay thin sticks over the opening and cover with light debris.
4. **Build guides:** Place low brush wings to channel movement toward the lid.
5. **Bait and check:** Use local grains or berries and inspect regularly.

Technical level: Basic digging and camouflage skills.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for lid sticks and guides, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for lashings, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** for anchoring and weighting.
- **Tools:** **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)**, knife.
- **Substitutes:** Packed snow walls, turf lid, or woven brush for the cover.

## Variants and improvements

- **Hinged lid:** A simple hinged cover that swings shut to reduce escape.
- **Snow pit:** Winter version with snow walls and a thin crust lid.
- **Wing funnel:** Longer guide wings to improve approach rate.
- **Clustered pits:** Multiple pits along a travel line to improve yield.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Can trap protected birds or small mammals.
- **Collapse:** Loose soil can cave in during digging.
- **Flooding:** Rain can fill pits and spoil use.
- **Legal limits:** Many regions restrict bird trapping.
