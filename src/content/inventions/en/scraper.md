# Brief description

A scraper is a unifacial stone tool (worked primarily on one side) designed with a steep, durable edge. It was essential for processing materials like animal hides and wood.

## Use / Function

- **Hide Processing:** Removing flesh and fat from animal skins (fleshing) and softening them for **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** production (part of **[Tanning](/en/knowledge/tanning)**).
- **Woodworking:** Shaping wooden shafts for spears or arrows, and smoothing surfaces.
- **Fiber Processing:** Stripping bark or processing plant fibers for cordage.

## Operating principle

**Abrasion/Shearing:** The steep edge acts as a plane. When dragged across a surface under pressure, it removes thin layers of material (shavings) without cutting deep or getting stuck, unlike a knife.

## How to create it

1.  **Flake Production:** Strike a suitable core stone to produce a large, thick flake.
2.  **Edge Selection:** Choose a naturally sharp edge on the flake.
3.  **Retouching:** Use a soft hammer (bone or antler) or a pressure flaker to chip away small flakes along the edge from one side only. This creates a steep, reinforced edge that resists chipping during heavy use.
4.  **Hafting (Optional):** Attach the scraper to a wooden or bone handle using resin and lashings for better leverage.

## Materials needed

- **Stone Flake:** Flint, chert, or obsidian.
- **Retouching Tool:** Antler tine, bone, or small stone.
- **(Optional) Handle:** Wood or bone.
- **(Optional) Adhesive:** Resin or pitch.

## Variants and improvements

- **End Scraper:** The working edge is on the narrow end of the flake (common for hide working).
- **Side Scraper:** The working edge is on the long side (common for woodworking).
- **Thumb Scraper:** A small, thumbnail-sized scraper.
- **Modern Scraper:** Metal blades used in carpentry and painting.

## Limits and risks

- **Dulling:** The edge dulls relatively quickly and requires frequent resharpening (retouching).
- **Fatigue:** Using a hand-held scraper for long periods is tiring for the fingers and wrist.
- **Specific Utility:** Not suitable for cutting or chopping; it is a specialized finishing tool.
