# Brief description

Dental prosthetics are artificial teeth or tooth parts made to replace missing or damaged teeth, restoring chewing function, protecting oral tissues, and improving speech and appearance.

## Use / Function

They restore essential oral functions:

- **Chewing**: Rebuilds biting surfaces so food can be processed.
- **Protection**: Covers gaps and sharp edges to reduce irritation and injury.
- **Stability**: Helps prevent nearby teeth from shifting.
- **Speech**: Improves clarity by restoring tongue contact points.
- **Scale**: Individual, custom-fitted items.

## Operating principle

The prosthetic reproduces the shape of missing teeth and anchors to the mouth with a stable base. It spreads bite forces over a larger area of gum and bone, using smooth, cleanable surfaces to limit irritation and infection. Retention comes from careful fit, friction, or simple clasps.

## How to create it

1. **Assess and measure**: Clean the mouth and check the gap size with a **[Mirror](/en/inventions/mirror)**.
2. **Make a mold**: Press **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** or soft **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** to capture the shape.
3. **Create tooth forms**: Carve **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for a simple tooth, or shape clay teeth and fire them in a **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)**.
4. **Build the base**: Use **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** or **[Natural Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)** as the plate; reinforce with **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)** or **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)** when available.
5. **Fit and adjust**: Smooth edges with a **[File](/en/inventions/file)** and **[Sandpaper](/en/materials/sandpaper)** until comfortable.
6. **Finish and sanitize**: Wash with **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)** and disinfect with **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**, **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)**, **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)**.
- **Optional durability**: **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)** or **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)** for supports.
- **Tools**: **[Mirror](/en/inventions/mirror)**, **[Kiln](/en/inventions/kiln)**, **[File](/en/inventions/file)**.
- **Hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Single-tooth peg**: A carved tooth tied or pinned into place for emergencies.
- **Partial plates**: Replace several teeth with a small base and simple clasps.
- **Full plates**: Replace an entire arch when most teeth are missing.
- **Ceramic teeth**: Fired clay teeth on a resin base for better wear resistance.

## Limits and risks

- **Poor fit**: Causes sores, inflammation, and unstable chewing.
- **Breakage**: Bone and ceramic can chip under hard loads.
- **Hygiene risk**: Trapped food and plaque can cause infection and odor.
- **Skill limits**: Unsafe fitting can damage gums and remaining teeth.
