# Brief description

A chisel is a tool with a characteristically shaped cutting edge of blade on its end, for carving or cutting a hard material such as wood, stone, or metal by hand, struck with a mallet, or applied with mechanical power.

## Use / Function

- **Woodworking:** Carving joints (mortise and tenon), shaping wood, woodturning on a lathe.
- **Masonry:** Cutting and shaping stone bricks or sculptures.
- **Metalworking:** Cutting cold metal (cold chisel) or removing waste material.

## Operating principle

The wedge shape of the blade concentrates force onto a small area, splitting or shearing the material. When used with a lathe, it acts as a fixed cutting point against a moving surface.

## How to create it

1.  **Forging:** Heat a metal rod (iron or steel) until malleable.
2.  **Shaping:** Hammer one end flat to create a blade.
3.  **Hardening:** Heat the blade to critical temperature and quench it (water or oil) to make it hard.
4.  **Tempering:** Reheat gently to reduce brittleness.
5.  **Sharpening:** Grind the edge to a precise angle (25-30 degrees for wood).
6.  **Handle:** Fit a wooden handle to the other end for grip and to absorb shock.

## Materials needed

- **Blade:** High-carbon steel (best), iron (needs frequent sharpening), or flint/obsidian (primitive).
- **Handle:** Hardwood (ash, hickory) or bone.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gouge:** Curved blade for carving hollows.
- **Skew Chisel:** Angled blade for smooth finishing on a lathe.
- **Cold Chisel:** Thick, tempered for cutting metal.

## Limits and risks

- **Dulling:** Requires frequent sharpening to work effectively and safely.
- **Chipping:** If the steel is too brittle (bad temper), the edge will chip on hard knots.
- **Safety:** Always cut away from the body. A dull chisel is more dangerous than a sharp one because it requires excessive force.
