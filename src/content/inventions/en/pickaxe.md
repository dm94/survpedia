# Brief description

A T-shaped hand tool used for prying, digging, and breaking hard surfaces. It typically has a head with a pointed end and a flattened end (chisel) mounted perpendicularly to the handle.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Breaking up hard soil, rock, and concrete.
- **Secondary uses:** Mining, prying out roots/stumps, agriculture (mattock), weapon.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

- **Concentrated Force:** The pointed tip concentrates the swing's energy into a tiny area, shattering hard materials.
- **Leverage:** The curve of the head and the long handle allow the user to pry apart rocks or soil.
- **Momentum:** The heavy head at the end of a swing builds significant kinetic energy.

## How to create it

1.  **Head Creation:**
    - **Primitive:** Use a deer antler (tine serves as pick) or a sharpened hard stone lashed to a handle.
    - **Metal:** Forge a bar of iron/steel. Point one end and flatten the other. Punch an eye in the center for the handle.
    - **Hardening:** Quench and temper the tips to prevent them from curling or dulling.
2.  **Handle:** Shape a strong, straight piece of hardwood (hickory, ash, oak).
3.  **Assembly:** Slide the handle through the eye. The eye is often tapered so the head slides down from the top and gets stuck (slip-fit), meaning centrifugal force tightens it.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Head:** Iron/Steel (best), Bronze, or Antler/Stone (primitive).
  - **Handle:** Durable hardwood.
- **Tools:**
  - **Forge/Anvil:** For metal heads.
  - **Grindstone:** For sharpening.
  - **Knife/Rasp:** For shaping the handle.

## Variants and improvements

- **Mattock:** Has a broad adze blade instead of a point, used for cutting roots and digging in soft soil.
- **Ice Axe:** Specialized for climbing ice.
- **Miner's Pick:** Often shorter for tight spaces.

## Limits and risks

- **Safety:** The sharp points are dangerous to the user and others nearby. Watch your backswing.
- **Fatigue:** Heavy to use; requires good technique to let gravity do the work.
- **Eye Protection:** Breaking rocks sends flying chips; eyes are at risk.
