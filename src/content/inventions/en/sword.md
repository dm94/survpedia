# Brief description

A bladed melee weapon intended for cutting or thrusting. It consists of a long metal blade and a hilt (handle) with a guard. It is a symbol of warfare and status.

## Use / Function

- **Combat**: Used for slashing, chopping, or thrusting at opponents.
- **Defense**: Can parry incoming blows.
- **Status**: Often a ceremonial symbol of authority or rank.

## Operating principle

The sword acts as a lever and a wedge.
- **Cutting**: The sharp edge concentrates force on a tiny area to sever material.
- **Thrusting**: The point concentrates force to pierce armor or flesh.
- **Balance**: The distribution of weight (controlled by the pommel and taper) determines if it cuts better (weight forward) or handles faster (weight back).

## How to create it

1.  **Forging**: A bar of steel is heated and hammered into the shape of a blade, tang, and point.
2.  **Shaping**: The bevels are ground in to create the edge geometry. **[Balancing](/en/knowledge/balancing)** is critical here.
3.  **Heat Treatment**: The blade is hardened (quenched) and tempered to be hard enough to hold an edge but tough enough not to snap.
4.  **Hilt Assembly**: A guard is fitted, the handle (wood/leather) is added, and a heavy pommel is peened onto the end of the tang to secure it and balance the sword.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: High-quality **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** (or **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)** historically).
- **Hilt**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**, bone, or metal wire.
- **Tools**: **[Forge](/en/inventions/forge)**, **[Anvil](/en/inventions/anvil)**, **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**, **[Grindstone](/en/inventions/hand-mill)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gladius**: Short thrusting sword.
- **Longsword**: Two-handed sword for reach and power.
- **Katana**: Curved single-edged sword optimized for cutting.
- **Rapier**: Thin, pointed sword optimized for thrusting and dueling.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance**: Rusts easily if not oiled; edges dull quickly.
- **Skill**: Requires significant training to use effectively without injuring oneself.
- **Brittleness**: Poor heat treatment can cause the blade to shatter on impact.
