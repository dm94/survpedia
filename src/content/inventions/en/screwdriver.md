# Brief description

A manual or powered tool used for turning screws. A typical screwdriver has a handle and a shaft, ending in a tip the user puts into the screw head before turning the handle.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Installing and removing screws.
- **Secondary uses**: Prying open lids, scraping (though not recommended).
- **Scale**: Manual, individual use.

## Operating principle

The screwdriver amplifies the torque applied by the user's hand.
- **Torque**: The larger diameter of the handle relative to the screw's shaft provides a mechanical advantage, allowing the user to generate more torque than would be possible by turning the screw shaft directly.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Shaft**: Forge or grind a steel rod to flatten one end into a wedge shape (for slotted screws).
2.  **Handle**: Carve a wooden handle with a central hole.
3.  **Assembly**: Heat the non-tip end of the shaft (tang) and drive it into the wooden handle, or use epoxy/glue.

### Technical level
- **Basic**: Requires basic metalworking to shape the tip and woodworking for the handle.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
    - **Steel**: Hardened steel for the tip is crucial to prevent it from twisting or snapping under torque.
    - **Wood/Plastic**: For the handle, to provide grip and leverage.
- **Tools**:
    - **File/Grinder**: To shape the tip precisely.
    - **Hammer**: To seat the shaft in the handle.

## Variants and improvements

- **Phillips/Cross-head**: Cruciform tip that self-centers but can cam out.
- **Robertson (Square)**: High torque transfer, less cam-out.
- **Torx**: Star-shaped pattern for high torque transmission.
- **Ratcheting**: Allows continuous turning without removing the tip from the screw head.

## Limits and risks

- **Stripping**: Using the wrong size or type of tip can damage the screw head (stripping it).
- **Cam-out**: The driver slipping out of the screw head under torque.
- **Tip breakage**: Hardened tips can be brittle; if used as a pry bar, they may snap.
