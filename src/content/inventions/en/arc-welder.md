# Arc Welder (Improvised)

A device that uses an electric arc to melt and join metals. In a survival situation, this can be improvised using car batteries connected in series.

## Use / Function

- **Joining Metals**: Repairing tools, vehicles, or structures.
- **Cutting**: At high amperage, can cut through thin metal.

## Operating Principle

An electric current jumps across a gap between the electrode and the workpiece, creating an intense arc of plasma (approx. 3500°C - 6000°C). This heat melts both the base metal and the electrode, fusing them together.

## How to create it (Battery Welder)

1.  **Power Source**: Connect 2 or 3 12V lead-acid **[Batteries](/en/inventions/battery)** in series to get 24V or 36V DC. This provides the necessary voltage to strike and maintain an arc.
    - Series connection: Battery 1 (+) to Battery 2 (-), Battery 2 (+) to Battery 3 (-).
2.  **Cables**: Use heavy-gauge **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** cables (like jumper cables) to handle the high current (50-100+ Amps).
3.  **Electrode Holder**: Clamp the positive cable to the **[Welding Electrode](/en/materials/welding-electrode)** using insulated pliers or a makeshift holder.
4.  **Ground Clamp**: Clamp the negative cable securely to the metal workpiece.
5.  **Welding**: Scratch the electrode tip against the workpiece to start the arc, then maintain a short gap.

## Materials needed

- **Batteries**: Lead-acid (car batteries) are best for high current.
- **Cables**: Thick copper wire to prevent melting.
- **Electrode Holder**: **[Pliers](/en/inventions/pliers)** with insulated handles.
- **Protection**: **[Protective Equipment](/en/knowledge/protective-equipment)** (Essential: Dark glass/mask to prevent blindness from UV, gloves).

## Variants and improvements

- **Stick Welder (Transformer)**: Uses a transformer to step down mains voltage (110/220V) to welding voltage (20-40V) while increasing current. Safer and more controllable than batteries.
- **Resistor Bank**: Adding a resistor (like a coil of steel wire) in series with the batteries can help control the current.

## Limits and risks

- **Blindness**: The UV light ("Arc Eye") can permanently damage eyes. NEVER look at the arc without proper shade 10-12 glass.
- **Explosion**: Batteries produce hydrogen. Keep them away from sparks (the arc).
- **Electrocution**: High current/voltage hazard.
- **Duty Cycle**: Batteries will drain quickly and may overheat.
- **Quality**: DC battery welding is actually very smooth, but lacks current control.
