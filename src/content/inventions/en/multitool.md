# Brief description

A portable, versatile device that combines several individual tools into a single compact unit. It is designed to provide a wide range of functionalities for repair, construction, and survival tasks without the need to carry a heavy toolbox.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: General-purpose maintenance, field repairs, and survival situations.
- **Secondary uses**: Crafting, first aid (removing splinters, cutting bandages), and food preparation.
- **Scale**: Personal, survival.

## Operating principle

The multitool typically operates on a folding mechanism where various tools (blades, drivers, pliers) pivot around a central axle or are stored within handles. When needed, a specific tool is deployed and locked into place for use.

- **Leverage**: Pliers and cutting tools utilize leverage to amplify force.
- **Torque**: Screwdrivers transfer rotational force.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

1.  **Selection**: Choose the essential tool heads needed (e.g., a blade and a screwdriver).
2.  **Fabrication**: Forge or grind these tools from steel.
3.  **Assembly**: Create a handle (wood or metal) with a pivot point (bolt or rivet) that allows the tools to rotate in and out.
4.  **Locking**: Implement a simple friction or spring mechanism to keep the tool open during use.

### Technical level

- **Intermediate to Advanced**: Requires precise metalworking, tempering, and assembly skills to ensure the tools are durable and fit together correctly.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **Steel**: High-carbon steel for blades (hardness) and tougher steel for pliers/handles (durability).
  - **Rivets/Pins**: For the pivot points.
- **Tools**:
  - **Forge/Anvil**: For shaping metal.
  - **Files/Grinder**: For sharpening and refining shapes.
  - **Drill**: For making pivot holes.
- **Possible substitutes**:
  - **Iron**: Can be used but will deform easier and hold an edge poorly.
  - **Bronze**: Suitable for non-critical parts or decoration, but poor for blades/tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pocket Knife Style**: Focuses on blades, can openers, and corkscrews (e.g., Swiss Army Knife).
- **Plier-based**: Built around a central pair of pliers with other tools in the handles.
- **Card/Wallet Tools**: Flat, single-piece metal with cutouts for wrenches and edges.
- **Improvements**: Locking mechanisms for safety, replaceable wire cutters, ergonomic grips.

## Limits and risks

- **Durability**: Generally less robust than dedicated, full-sized tools. Heavy torque can break the pivot or the tool itself.
- **Ergonomics**: Handles are often blocky or uncomfortable during prolonged use.
- **Safety**: Non-locking blades can fold back on the user's fingers.
