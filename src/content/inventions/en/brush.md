# Brief description

A brush is a handheld tool consisting of bristles attached to a handle, used for applying paint, ink, or other substances, as well as for cleaning or grooming. It allows for the controlled transfer of liquid or powder to a surface.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Application of paint or ink for art, writing, or decoration.
- **Secondary uses**: Cleaning (dusting), grooming (hairbrush), application of glues or cosmetics.
- **Scale**: Domestic to industrial (from fine art to house painting).

## Operating principle

The bristles hold the liquid (paint/ink) through capillary action and surface tension. When pressed against a surface, the bristles bend and release the liquid. The flexibility of the bristles allows for varying line widths and textures depending on the pressure applied.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

1.  Gather a small bundle of animal hair or stiff plant fibers.
2.  Tie them tightly together at one end.
3.  Insert the tied end into a hollow stick (reed or quill) or bind it to a stick.
4.  Secure with glue or resin.

### Essential steps

1.  **Selection**: Choose bristles based on desired stiffness (boar for coarse, sable/squirrel for fine).
2.  **Cleaning**: Wash bristles to remove grease (unless natural oils are desired).
3.  **Bundling**: Align the tips (do not cut the tips of natural hair, as the tapered end is crucial for flow).
4.  **Ferrule**: Create a collar (metal, quill, or wrapped string) to hold the bristles shape.
5.  **Hafting**: Attach the ferrule to the handle.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - Bristles: Animal hair (horse, hog, badger, sable), plant fibers (sisal, coconut), or synthetic.
  - Handle: Wood, bamboo, bone.
  - Binding: String, wire, **[leather](/en/materials/leather)** strip.
- **Tools**: Knife, scissors (for trimming base, not tips), [Glue](../../materials/en/glue.md)/[Resin](../../materials/en/resin.md).

## Variants and improvements

- **Early versions**: Chewed sticks (fibers separated at the end), bundles of moss or fur tied to a stick.
- **Calligraphy Brush**: Tapered point for variable line width, typically bamboo handle and wolf/goat hair.
- **Flat Brush**: Metal ferrule flattens the bristles for covering large areas.
- **Roller**: A rolling cylinder for covering very large flat surfaces quickly (modern improvement).

## Limits and risks

- **Shedding**: Poorly bound brushes lose hairs in the paint.
- **Shape retention**: Poor quality bristles splay out and lose their point/edge.
- **Cleaning**: Paint dried in the heel (near the ferrule) ruins the brush. Must be cleaned immediately after use.
