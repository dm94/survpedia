# Brief description

A mechanical device that uses a swinging weight (pendulum) as a timekeeping element. Its advantage lies in its precision, much higher than sundials or water clocks, allowing for accurate measurement of seconds and minutes.

## Use / Function

- **Precision Timekeeping:** Measuring time with an error of seconds per day.
- **Science and Navigation:** Fundamental for physical experiments and, in advanced versions (marine chronometers), for navigation.
- **Social Coordination:** Standardization of schedules in cities and stations.

## Operating principle

Based on the **isochronism of the pendulum**: the period of oscillation depends on its length, not amplitude (for small angles).

1. **Energy Source:** A falling weight or coiled spring provides energy.
2. **Gear Train:** Transmits energy and counts oscillations.
3. **Escapement:** The key mechanism (like the anchor escapement) that gives a small push to the pendulum to keep it swinging and allows the gears to advance a fixed amount with each swing.

## How to create it

1. **Pendulum:** A long rod with an adjustable weight at the end.
2. **Escapement Mechanism:** Build an escape [wheel](/en/inventions/wheel) (saw-toothed) and an anchor that locks and releases the wheel to the rhythm of the pendulum.
3. **Weights:** A system of weights and [pulleys](/en/inventions/pulley) to drive the gear train.
4. **Dial:** A gear reduction system to move hour and minute hands.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Metal (brass or iron) for gears and escapement, wood for structure and pendulum rod.
- **Tools:** Precision files, drill, lathe (for axles and wheels).
- **Substitutes:** Basic wooden versions can be made, but friction and humidity will affect accuracy.

## Variants and improvements

- **Anchor Escapement:** Improves accuracy by requiring less oscillation amplitude.
- **Temperature Compensated Pendulum:** Uses different metals (like the gridiron pendulum) to counteract thermal expansion.
- **Cuckoo Clock:** Decorative variant with automata.

## Limits and risks

- **Immobility:** Must remain stationary and level; movement alters the pendulum's period (useless on ships without complex modifications).
- **Friction:** Requires regular lubrication and cleaning.
- **Length:** For a 2-second period (1 sec swing each way), the pendulum must be nearly 1 meter long.
