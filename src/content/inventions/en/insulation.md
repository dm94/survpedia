# Brief description

Insulation refers to materials or systems designed to reduce the transfer of heat (thermal insulation), sound (acoustic insulation), or electricity. In the context of survival and construction, thermal insulation is critical for maintaining habitable temperatures within a shelter or clothing.

## Use / Function

- **Thermal Regulation:** Keeps the interior warm in winter and cool in summer by slowing down heat flow.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Reduces the fuel needed for heating or cooling.
- **Condensation Control:** Prevents warm moist air from condensing on cold surfaces (like roofs).
- **Soundproofing:** Dampens external noise.

## Operating principle

Most thermal insulation works by trapping **dead air** (still air) within a matrix of solid material. Air is a poor conductor of heat when it cannot circulate (convection). Materials like wool, straw, or foam have millions of tiny air pockets that resist heat transfer.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection:** Choose a material with high porosity and low density.
2.  **Installation:**
    - _Walls:_ Fill the cavity between studs with the material (**[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**, wool, moss).
    - _Roof:_ Lay thick layers (batts or loose fill) on the attic floor or between rafters.
    - _Floors:_ Place insulation between floor joists.
3.  **Sealing:** Ensure there are no gaps (thermal bridges) where heat can bypass the insulation.
4.  **Vapor Barrier:** Install a barrier (plastic, foil) on the warm side of the insulation to prevent moisture from entering and reducing its effectiveness.

## Materials needed

- **[Straw](/en/materials/straw):** Excellent natural insulator (bale construction).
- **[Wool](/en/materials/wool):** Sheep's wool is fire-resistant and manages moisture well.
- **Cork:** Bark of the cork oak; water-resistant and rot-proof.
- **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers):** Hemp, flax, or cotton.
- **Sawdust/Wood Shavings:** Cheap byproduct, but settles over time and flammable.
- **Snow:** Igloos use the air trapped in snow for insulation.
- **Modern:** Fiberglass, mineral wool, polystyrene foam.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bulk Insulation:** Relies on thickness and trapped air (fiberglass, wool).
- **Reflective Insulation:** Uses shiny surfaces (foil) to reflect radiant heat (effective in hot climates).
- **Vacuum Insulation Panels:** Removing air creates a near-perfect insulator (high tech).
- **Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs):** Sandwich of foam between structural boards.

## Limits and risks

- **Moisture:** Wet insulation loses its ability to trap air (except wool/cork) and can rot or grow mold.
- **Compression:** Squeezing insulation reduces the air pockets and lowers its effectiveness (R-value).
- **Pests:** Rodents and insects love to nest in soft insulation.
- **Fire:** Many natural insulators (straw, sawdust) are flammable and need fire-retardant treatment.
- **Health:** Fiberglass and asbestos (obsolete) can damage lungs and skin.
