# Brief description

An incubator is a protected warm enclosure that helps a newborn maintain safe body temperature, especially when the baby is premature, weak, or exposed to cold.

## Use / Function

- **Thermal stability**: Keep the baby within a safe temperature range.
- **Protection**: Reduce exposure to drafts, dirt, and handling stress.
- **Observation**: Allow frequent checks without excessive heat loss.
- **Scale**: Individual care at home or small clinics.

## Operating principle

- **Insulation**: A closed box slows heat loss by reducing airflow.
- **Gentle heat source**: Warm water or heated clay provides stable warmth.
- **Moisture control**: Slight humidity helps reduce drying and heat loss.
- **Monitoring**: Frequent touch checks and short openings prevent overheating.

## How to create it

1. **Build an enclosure**: Make a small box from **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** with a viewing window using **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or a clear opening covered by clean **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**.
2. **Add insulation**: Line the walls with folded **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or padded **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, keeping the baby off direct contact with the heat source.
3. **Prepare a gentle heat source**: Use a sealed **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pot or bottle filled with warm **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, or warmed clay tiles heated near **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**.
4. **Vent and position**: Create small vents and place the heat source on one side so the baby can be moved away if it is too warm.
5. **Monitor often**: Check the baby’s skin warmth and color frequently and refresh the warm water as it cools.
6. **Technical level**: Basic to intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or clean **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**.
- **Heat source**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pot or tiles, **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for controlled heating.
- **Tools**: Cutting tools, basic joinery tools, clean wrapping cloths.
- **Possible substitutes**: Wicker basket with layered cloths, warmed stones wrapped in fabric, double-box with air gap for insulation.

## Variants and improvements

- **Double-wall box**: Air gap between walls improves insulation.
- **Water bath tray**: Shallow warm water under the bed surface for gentler heat.
- **Mesh window**: Improves airflow while limiting drafts.
- **Modern incubator**: Thermostat control and oxygen monitoring.

## Limits and risks

- **Overheating**: Excess heat can dehydrate or harm the newborn.
- **Cold stress**: Poor insulation or weak heat source can drop temperature.
- **Fire risk**: Charcoal or hot stones can ignite fabrics if too close.
- **Contamination**: Unclean fabrics or containers increase infection risk.
