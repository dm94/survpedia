# Brief description

A fishing net is a mesh of cordage used to entangle or enclose fish, enabling larger catches than single-hook methods.

## Use / Function

- **Containment**: Surrounds or blocks fish movement.
- **Efficiency**: Captures multiple fish in a single set.
- **Adaptability**: Works in rivers, lakes, and coastal waters.

## Operating principle

Uniform mesh openings guide fish into pockets or against barriers. Floats keep the net upper edge at the surface while weights hold the lower edge down, forming a vertical wall or enclosure.

## How to create it

1. **Make twine**: Twist **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** into thin cord.
2. **Knot the mesh**: Use a netting needle and spacer to tie consistent squares.
3. **Add floats**: Lash **[Cork](/en/materials/cork)** or carved **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** to the top line.
4. **Add sinkers**: Tie **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** along the bottom line.
5. **Inspect and repair**: Replace broken knots before each use.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Plant fiber twine for mesh.
- **Structure**: Wooden float line and stone sinkers.
- **Tools**: Knife, awl, netting needle, measuring spacer.

## Variants and improvements

- **Cast net**: Thrown by hand for quick capture.
- **Gill net**: Mesh sized to catch fish by the gills.
- **Seine net**: Pulled to enclose fish against shore.

## Limits and risks

- **Bycatch**: Mesh can trap non-target species.
- **Snagging**: Nets tear on rocks and submerged wood.
- **Labor**: Repair and drying require regular effort.
