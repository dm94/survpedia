# Brief description

A component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors, hydraulic cylinders and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** To transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod (in an engine) OR to transfer force from the crankshaft to the fluid in the cylinder for the purpose of compressing or pumping the fluid (in a pump).

## Operating principle

- **In an Engine:** Expanding gas (combustion or steam) pushes against the piston head, forcing it down the cylinder. This linear motion is converted to rotary motion.
- **In a Pump:** The piston is pulled/pushed, creating a vacuum (suction) or pressure (compression) to move a fluid.

## How to create it

### Simple Piston

1.  **Head (Crown):** The top surface that withstands the pressure/heat. Usually **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)** or **[Aluminum](/en/materials/aluminum)** (lighter).
2.  **Skirt:** The side walls that guide the piston in the cylinder bore.
3.  **Pin (Wrist Pin):** A hollow steel shaft that connects the piston to the connecting rod.
4.  **Rings:** **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** rings that fit into grooves on the piston. They spring outward to seal against the cylinder wall, preventing gas blow-by and scraping oil.

## Materials needed

- **Piston:** **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)** (durable, heat resistant), **[Aluminum](/en/materials/aluminum)** (light, good heat conduction), or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
- **Rings:** **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)** or Chrome-plated **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
- **Pin:** Hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Trunk Piston:** Standard design (like in a car engine).
- **Crosshead Piston:** Used in large engines (ships/steam); the piston rod connects to a crosshead which slides in guides, taking the side thrust off the piston.
- **Plunger:** A solid cylinder used in pumps; simpler to seal.

## Limits and risks

- **Seizure:** If the piston expands more than the cylinder (due to heat), it can get stuck (seize), destroying the engine. Clearance is critical.
- **Slap:** If the clearance is too loose, the piston rocks and makes noise (piston slap).
- **Blow-by:** Worn rings allow gas to leak past, reducing power and contaminating oil.
