# Brief description

Firing is the process of applying controlled high heat to materials to alter their chemical or physical properties. It is a fundamental technique for creating durable construction materials like [bricks](/en/materials/brick) and [cement](/en/materials/cement), as well as [pottery](/en/inventions/pottery) and metals.

## Use / Function

- **[Ceramics](/en/materials/ceramics):** Transforms soft [clay](/en/materials/clay) into hard, water-resistant pottery.
- **Construction:** Hardens [bricks](/en/materials/brick) for building and calcinates [limestone](/en/materials/limestone) to produce [lime](/en/materials/lime) and [cement](/en/materials/cement).
- **Metallurgy:** Smelts ores to extract metals like [copper](/en/materials/copper) and [iron](/en/materials/iron).
- **Food Preservation:** Smoking and drying food (at lower temperatures).
- **Charcoal Production:** Pyrolysis of [wood](/en/materials/wood) in a low-oxygen environment.

## Operating principle

Firing works by subjecting materials to specific temperature ranges:

1.  **Drying (up to 100°C):** Removes physical water.
2.  **Dehydration (350°C - 500°C):** Removes chemically bound water.
3.  **Oxidation/Reduction (varies):** Chemical reactions with oxygen or carbon.
4.  **Vitrification/Sintering (900°C+):** Particles fuse together, closing pores and increasing density and strength.
5.  **Calcination (800°C - 1000°C):** Breaks down calcium carbonate into calcium oxide (quicklime).

## How to perform it

1.  **Preparation:** Ensure materials are dry to prevent exploding from steam pressure.
2.  **Loading:** Stack items in a [kiln](/en/inventions/kiln) or pit, ensuring space for airflow.
3.  **Preheating:** Start with a small fire to raise temperature gradually.
4.  **Firing:** Increase fuel to reach the target temperature. Maintain (soak) for the required time.
5.  **Cooling:** Allow the kiln to cool slowly to prevent thermal shock and cracking.

## Materials needed

- **Fuel:** [Wood](/en/materials/wood), [charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal), [coal](/en/materials/coal), or peat.
- **Container:** A [kiln](/en/inventions/kiln), pit, or clamp (temporary structure).
- **Temperature Control:** [Bellows](/en/inventions/bellows) for higher heat, dampers for airflow.

## Variants and improvements

- **Open Firing:** Bonfire or pit (low control, low temp).
- **Kiln Firing:** Enclosed chamber (high control, high temp).
- **Reduction Firing:** Limiting oxygen to change colors (e.g., black pottery) or smelt metals.
- **Bisque Firing:** First firing of clay before glazing.
- **Glaze Firing:** Second firing to melt the glaze.

## Limits and risks

- **Thermal Shock:** Rapid heating/cooling cracks materials.
- **Explosions:** Trapped moisture turns to steam.
- **Fuel Consumption:** Requires large amounts of fuel.
- **Burns:** High risk of injury from heat and hot materials.
- **Toxic Fumes:** Carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and other gases.
