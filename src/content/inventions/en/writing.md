# Brief description

Writing is a system of graphic representation of a language by means of signs engraved or drawn on a support. It is the basis of history and complex administration.

## Use / Function

- **Record-keeping:** Accounting, laws, and censuses.
- **Communication:** Sending messages over long distances.
- **Preservation:** Storing knowledge for future generations.
- **Identity:** Personal signatures and seals.

## Operating principle

It is based on assigning specific meanings to arbitrary visual symbols. These can represent ideas (ideograms), syllables, or individual sounds (alphabets), allowing spoken language to be encoded in a durable format.

## How to create it

1. **Definition:** Establish a common code of signs.
2. **Support:** Prepare a flat surface (wet clay, papyrus, paper).
3. **Application:** Use a tool (stylus, pen, brush) to mark the code on the support.

## Materials needed

- **Supports:** Clay tablets, papyrus (plant fibers), parchment (leather), paper.
- **Inks:** Charcoal mixed with binders, vegetable dyes.
- **Tools:** Sharpened reeds, brushes, bird quills.

## Variants and improvements

- **Cuneiform:** Engraved in clay with wedge shapes.
- **Hieroglyphs:** Based on images.
- **Alphabet:** Efficient phonetic system (e.g., Phoenician, Latin).
- **Printing Press:** Mechanization of text production.

## Limits and risks

- **Fragility:** Paper and papyrus can burn or rot.
- **Interpretation:** Codes can be forgotten (dead languages).
- **Access:** Historically limited by illiteracy and the cost of materials.
