# Brief description

A structural framework composed of straight members connected at joints, typically forming triangles. It is designed to support loads over a span while using significantly less material than a solid beam.

## Use / Function

-   **Bridges**: Allows for long spans with lightweight structures.
-   **Roofs**: Supports the weight of roofs in houses, barns, and large halls.
-   **Cranes and Towers**: Provides high strength-to-weight ratio for vertical structures.
-   **Scale**: From small house roof rafters to massive railway bridges.

## Operating principle

The truss works through the **geometric stability of the triangle**.
1.  A triangle is the only polygon that is inherently rigid; its shape cannot be changed without changing the length of its sides.
2.  Loads applied at the joints are converted into **tension** (pulling) or **compression** (pushing) forces along the members.
3.  Because the members only deal with axial forces (tension/compression) rather than bending, they can be much thinner and lighter than a solid beam.

## How to create it

1.  **Design**: Choose a truss pattern (e.g., King Post, Pratt, Warren) based on the span and load.
2.  **Preparation**: Cut members (wood beams or metal bars) to precise lengths.
3.  **Joints**: Connect members at the nodes.
    -   **Wood**: Use bolts, gusset plates, or traditional joinery (mortise and tenon).
    -   **Metal**: Use welding, rivets, or bolts.
4.  **Assembly**: Build the triangles one by one, ensuring all joints are secure.
5.  **Installation**: Lift the truss into place and secure it to the supports.

## Materials needed

-   **Essential**:
    -   **Wood**: Hardwood or softwood depending on the load.
    -   **Steel/Iron**: For high-strength industrial applications.
    -   **Fasteners**: Bolts, nails, rivets, or welding rods.
-   **Tools**: Saws, drills, wrenches, welding equipment (if metal), levels.

## Variants and improvements

-   **King Post**: Simple triangle with a central vertical post.
-   **Pratt Truss**: Vertical members are in compression, diagonals in tension.
-   **Warren Truss**: Uses equilateral triangles (alternating diagonals).
-   **Space Frame**: A 3D truss that can span large areas in two directions.

## Limits and risks

-   **Buckling**: Long members in compression can bend or snap if they are too thin.
-   **Joint Failure**: The joints are the weakest points; if a bolt shears or a weld cracks, the whole structure can collapse.
-   **Corrosion**: Rust in metal trusses or rot in wooden ones can compromise structural integrity.
-   **Improper Loading**: Trusses are designed for loads at the joints; hanging heavy weights from the middle of a member can cause failure.
