# Brief description

Solar ignition uses focused sunlight from a lens or reflective surface to heat tinder until it ignites.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Create fire using sunlight.
- **Secondary uses:** Safe ignition without sparks or friction.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

A lens or mirror concentrates sunlight into a small focal point. The intense heat dries and ignites tinder at the focus.

## How to create it

1. **Choose a lens or reflector:** Glass lens, polished metal, or clear ice if conditions allow.
2. **Prepare tinder:** Fine, dry fibers or charred plant material.
3. **Focus light:** Adjust distance until the brightest, smallest spot appears.
4. **Ignite:** Hold the tinder at the focus until it smolders, then blow gently.
5. **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Lens or reflector, tinder bundle.
- **Tools:** Holder or frame to keep the lens steady.
- **Substitutes:** A clear water-filled container as a crude lens.

## Variants and improvements

- **Parabolic mirror:** Faster ignition and higher temperatures.
- **Lens mount:** Frees hands for tinder control.
- **Dark tinder:** Charred fibers absorb heat better.

## Limits and risks

- **Weather dependence:** Requires strong, direct sunlight.
- **Slow ignition:** Cloud cover can prevent ignition.
- **Eye safety:** Reflected light can damage vision.
