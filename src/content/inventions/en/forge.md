# Brief description

A specialized hearth or fireplace designed to heat metals to a high temperature, making them malleable for shaping (forging) or liquid for casting (foundry work). It is the heart of a blacksmith's workshop.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is **controlled heating**.

- **Forging**: Heating iron or steel until it glows red, orange, or white hot so it can be hammered into shape.
- **Welding**: Heating two pieces of metal to near melting point to fuse them together (forge welding).
- **Annealing**: Heating and slowly cooling metal to soften it and relieve internal stresses.
- **Smelting/Melting**: With sufficient airflow and insulation, it can melt metals like copper, bronze, or even iron in a crucible.

## Operating principle

The forge relies on **forced draft combustion**.

- **Fuel**: Charcoal or coal provides the carbon for burning.
- **Oxygen**: A bellows or blower forces air into the fire through a nozzle called a **tuyere**. This extra oxygen drastically increases the rate of combustion, raising the temperature far beyond what a natural draft fire can achieve (up to 2000°C / 3600°F).
- **Insulation**: The hearth structure reflects heat back into the center, concentrating it on the workpiece.

## How to create it

### Basic Earth Forge (Primitive)

1.  **Dig a Pit**: Dig a small hole in the ground (about 30cm wide and 15cm deep).
2.  **Air Supply**: Dig a trench or insert a pipe (clay, bamboo, or metal) leading to the bottom side of the pit. This is the **tuyere**.
3.  **Lining**: Line the pit with clay or mud to prevent the earth from crumbling and to reflect heat.
4.  **Bellows**: Connect a bellows (made of leather bags or wood) to the pipe to pump air.

### Raised Forge (Permanent)

1.  **Structure**: Build a waist-high table from stone or brick.
2.  **Firepot**: Create a depression in the center lined with fire-resistant clay or cast iron.
3.  **Air System**: Install a tuyere at the bottom of the firepot, connected to a hand-cranked blower or large bellows.
4.  **Hood (Optional)**: Build a chimney or hood above to carry away smoke.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **Refractory Material**: Clay, stone, or firebrick that can withstand high heat without cracking or melting.
  - **Air Pipe (Tuyere)**: Iron pipe is best, but clay or even hollow wood (kept wet/cool) can work in a pinch.
  - **Fuel**: **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** or **[Coal](/en/materials/coal)**.
- **Tools**: Shovel, Trowel.

## Variants and improvements

- **Side-Blast Forge**: The air enters from the side. Common in primitive and early medieval forges. The tuyere is less likely to clog with ash (clinker).
- **Bottom-Blast Forge**: The air enters from the bottom. Provides a very hot, concentrated fire but the tuyere can get clogged with molten slag.
- **Gas Forge**: Uses propane or natural gas. Cleaner and easier to control, but requires modern fuel tanks.

## Limits and risks

- **Fuel Consumption**: A forge consumes fuel rapidly. A constant supply of charcoal is needed.
- **Burning Metal**: If the airflow is too strong or the metal is left too long, steel can "burn" (spark excessively and become brittle) or melt completely.
- **Carbon Monoxide**: Burning charcoal/coal produces deadly CO gas. **Always** use in a well-ventilated area.
- Fire Hazard: Sparks and heat can ignite the surroundings.
