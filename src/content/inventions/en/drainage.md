# Brief description

A system designed to remove excess water from the ground surface or from the soil root zone. It is essential for agriculture, construction stability, and sanitation.

## Use / Function

- **Sanitation:** Removal of wastewater and sewage to prevent disease.
- **Agriculture:** Preventing soil waterlogging which can rot plant roots.
- **Construction:** Keeping foundations dry to prevent shifting and structural damage.
- **Flood Control:** Directing rainwater away from inhabited areas.

## Operating principle

It relies primarily on **gravity** and **slope**. Water naturally flows from higher to lower elevations. Drainage systems provide a path of least resistance for water to flow away from the protected area, often utilizing a gradient (slope) to ensure continuous movement.

## How to create it

1.  **Surveying:** Identify the low point where water collects and determine a discharge point (lower than the area to be drained).
2.  **Trenching:** Dig a trench with a consistent downward slope (at least 1%) towards the discharge point.
3.  **Lining (Optional):** Line the trench with stones or a porous material to prevent collapse.
4.  **Filling (French Drain):** Fill the trench with coarse gravel or stones to allow water to flow through the voids.
5.  **Piping (Advanced):** Lay perforated pipes (clay, bamboo) at the bottom of the trench before filling with gravel to increase capacity.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Shovels, picks for digging.
- **Fill Material:** Gravel, loose stones, broken pottery.
- **Conduits:** Clay pipes, bamboo stems (nodes removed), or hollow logs.
- **Tools:** Level (water level or A-frame) to ensure proper slope.

## Variants and improvements

- **Open Ditches:** Simple trenches used in agriculture; effective but take up space and can be dangerous.
- **French Drains:** Covered trenches filled with gravel; useful for foundations and residential areas.
- **Roman Drainage:** Complex systems using stone-lined channels and lead or ceramic pipes.
- **Modern Storm Sewers:** Large scale concrete networks.

## Limits and risks

- **Clogging:** Silt and roots can block the drains over time. Maintenance is required.
- **Erosion:** High water velocity at the outlet can cause soil erosion.
- **Backflow:** If the discharge point floods, water can flow back into the drained area.
- **Contamination:** Drainage water can carry pollutants; care must be taken where it is discharged.
