# Brief description

A device used to measure the passage of a determined period of time. It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of material (usually sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one.

## Use / Function

- **Timer:** Measuring short, fixed intervals (cooking, games, sermons, watches on ships).
- **Durability:** Works on ships where pendulum clocks fail due to motion.
- **Symbolism:** Representation of time running out.

## Operating principle

Gravity pulls the granular material through the narrow neck. Unlike water, dry sand (or similar material) flows at a constant rate regardless of the height of the column in the upper bulb, provided the neck is narrow enough and the grains are uniform.

## How to create it

1.  **Bulbs:** Blow two glass bulbs or use two separate bottles joined at the necks.
2.  **Neck:** Ensure a smooth, narrow passage. A metal plate with a precise hole can be placed between the bulbs to regulate flow.
3.  **Fill:** Use fine, dry, uniform sand, powdered eggshells, or marble dust. Sift carefully to remove large particles.
4.  **Seal:** Hermetically seal the connection to prevent moisture from entering (which clumps the sand).
5.  **Frame:** Mount in a protective wooden or metal frame.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** for visibility and smoothness.
- **Flow Material:** **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** (washed and dried), pulverized eggshells, or metal oxides.
- **Structure:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)** for the stand.

## Variants and improvements

- **Multiple Glasses:** Several hourglasses mounted together for different intervals (e.g., 15, 30, 60 minutes).
- **Rotatable Mount:** Easy turning mechanism on a wall or stand.

## Limits and risks

- **Fixed Interval:** Can only measure the specific time it was designed for.
- **Clogging:** Moisture or irregular grains can stop the flow.
- **Breakage:** Glass is fragile.
- **Wear:** Sand can erode the neck over time, changing the flow rate (widening the hole).
