# Brief description

A man-made channel constructed to convey water from a distant source to a point of use, such as a city, farm, or industrial site.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Supplying fresh water for drinking, irrigation, and baths.
- **Secondary uses:** Driving watermills, mining (hushing), and removing waste (sewers).
- **Scale:** Massive civil engineering projects spanning kilometers.

## Operating principle

- **Gravity Flow:** The entire system relies on a continuous, very gradual downward slope (gradient) to keep water moving.
- **Bridges and Siphons:** Arched bridges carry the channel across valleys, while inverted siphons (pressurized pipes) can cross deeper depressions.

## How to create it

1.  **Surveying:** Use tools like a **[level](/en/inventions/level)** (chorobates) to find a source higher than the destination and map a route with a constant slope.
2.  **Tunnelling:** Dig tunnels through hills to maintain a direct path and protect the water.
3.  **Construction:** Build the channel (specus) from **[stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** lined with waterproof **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)**.
4.  **Bridging:** Construct arched bridges to cross valleys or rivers.
5.  **Distribution:** At the destination, use a castellum (water tower) to settle sediment and distribute water via **[pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)**.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** (Roman).
- **Waterproofing:** Hydraulic **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** (mixed with crushed pottery or pozzolana), **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** (for pipes).
- **Tools:** **[Pickaxes](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**, **[shovels](/en/inventions/shovel)**, **[levels](/en/inventions/level)**, **[cranes](/en/inventions/crane)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Open Channel:** Simple ditch for irrigation (high evaporation).
- **Covered Channel:** Stone or concrete tunnel to prevent evaporation and contamination.
- **Pressurized Pipeline:** Modern aqueducts often use pumps and pressure, allowing them to go uphill.

## Limits and risks

- **Gradient:** Too steep, and water damages the structure; too shallow, and it stagnates.
- **Maintenance:** Mineral buildup (sinter) must be cleaned regularly.
- **Cost:** Extremely expensive and labor-intensive to build.
- **Vulnerability:** Strategic target in war (cutting water supply).
