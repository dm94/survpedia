# Brief description

A cart is a two-wheeled vehicle designed for transport, typically pulled by a person or a draft animal. It is a fundamental advancement in logistics, allowing for the movement of loads far heavier than what can be carried.

## Use / Function

- **Transport of Goods:** Moving crops, wood, stones, or trade goods.
- **Transport of People:** Basic transportation for travel.
- **Warfare:** Early chariots were essentially specialized carts.

## Operating principle

The cart utilizes the wheel and axle to reduce friction.

- **Load Distribution:** The load is balanced over the axle, meaning the draft animal (or person) only needs to overcome rolling resistance and inertia, rather than supporting the full weight.
- **Rolling vs. Sliding:** Wheels roll over the ground, drastically reducing friction compared to a [sled](/en/inventions/sled).

## How to create it

1.  **Frame Construction:** Build a rectangular frame from sturdy wood planks.
2.  **Axle Mounting:** Securely attach the axle (see [Axle](/en/inventions/axle)) to the underside of the frame.
3.  **Wheel Attachment:** Mount the wheels (see [Wheel](/en/inventions/wheel)) onto the axle.
4.  **Shafts/Tongue:** Attach two long shafts (for a single animal) or a central tongue (for pairs) to the front of the frame.
5.  **Harnessing:** Use **[leather](/en/materials/leather)** or rope to connect the shafts to the animal.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Planks for the body, beams for the frame and shafts.
- **Axle:** A strong wooden or metal axle.
- **Wheels:** Two sturdy wheels.
- **Fasteners:** Nails, pegs, or rope to hold the structure together.

## Variants and improvements

- **Handcart:** Smaller, pushed or pulled by a human.
- **[Wagon](/en/inventions/wagon):** A four-wheeled vehicle (requires a steering mechanism for the front axle).
- **[Chariot](/en/inventions/chariot):** Lightweight, fast cart for war or racing.
- **Tumbrel:** A cart that can tilt to dump its load.

## Limits and risks

- **Terrain:** Difficult to use on very rough, muddy, or steep terrain.
- **Balance:** If the load is not balanced over the axle, it puts excessive strain on the animal (lifting them up or pushing them down).
- **Maintenance:** Axles need regular greasing; wheels can break.
