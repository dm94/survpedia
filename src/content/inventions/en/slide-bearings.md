# Brief description

A slide bearing (or plain bearing) is the simplest type of bearing, comprising just a bearing surface and no rolling elements. Therefore, the journal (the part of the shaft in contact with the bearing) slides over the bearing surface.

## Use / Function

- **Primary Use:** To support a rotating shaft and reduce friction between moving parts.
- **Secondary Uses:** Linear motion guides (like on a lathe bed).
- **Scale:** Used in everything from small clocks to massive steam engines and ship propeller shafts.

## Operating principle

The bearing supports the load while allowing the shaft to rotate. The key is to separate the metal surfaces with a film of lubricant (oil, grease, or even water/air).

- **Hydrodynamic Lubrication:** As the shaft spins, it drags a wedge of oil under itself, lifting it off the bearing surface. This "fluid film" prevents metal-to-metal contact and wear.

## How to create it

### Basic Bronze Bushing

1.  **Housing:** A hole in a rigid support (like a cast iron pillow block) to hold the bearing.
2.  **Bushing (Liner):** A sleeve made of a material softer than the shaft, such as **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, or Babbitt metal (a soft alloy of tin, antimony, and copper).
    - If the bearing seizes, the cheap bushing is sacrificed to save the expensive shaft.
3.  **Grooves:** Cut small channels (oil grooves) into the inner surface of the bushing to distribute the lubricant.
4.  **Lubrication:** A hole or cup (oil cup/grease fitting) to feed **[Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** or **[Grease](/en/materials/animal-fat)** into the bearing.

### Lignum Vitae Bearing (for water)

1.  **Material:** Use **[Lignum Vitae](/en/materials/lignum-vitae)** (an extremely dense, oily wood) or similar hard woods.
2.  **Application:** Excellent for underwater applications (like water wheels or ship propeller shafts) because the wood's natural oils and the water itself act as lubricants.

## Materials needed

- **Bushing:** **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**, Babbitt metal, **[Lignum Vitae](/en/materials/lignum-vitae)**, or even oil-soaked **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** (for light loads).
- **Shaft:** Hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**.
- **Housing:** **[Cast Iron](/en/materials/cast-iron)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**.
- **Lubricant:** **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**, **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**, Mineral Oil.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bushing:** A simple one-piece sleeve.
- **Split Bearing:** The housing and bearing are split into two halves (top and bottom), allowing for installation around a shaft without removing the ends, and for adjustment as the bearing wears (by removing shims).
- **Self-Aligning:** The bearing can tilt slightly to accommodate shaft misalignment.
- **Porous Bronze (Oilite):** Sintered bronze impregnated with oil; self-lubricating for light loads.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction:** Higher starting friction than ball bearings (stiction).
- **Lubrication:** Critical. If the oil film fails, rapid wear and heat generation (seizure) occur.
- **Speed:** High speeds generate significant heat; requires pressure lubrication and cooling.
