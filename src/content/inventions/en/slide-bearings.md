# Brief description

Slide bearings, also known as plain bearings or journal bearings, are the simplest type of bearing used to support rotating shafts. They consist of a smooth surface (often a soft metal or wood) against which a shaft rotates, separated by a thin film of lubricant. They are crucial for heavy machinery like [Flywheels](/en/inventions/flywheel) and [Steam Engines](/en/inventions/steam-engine).

## Use / Function

- **Load Support:** They support heavy radial loads (perpendicular to the shaft) better than many rolling-element bearings at low speeds.
- **Friction Reduction:** They minimize friction between a moving shaft and a stationary housing.
- **Shock Absorption:** The oil film dampens vibrations and shocks, making them ideal for engines and crushers.
- **Scale:** From small clock mechanisms to massive industrial [Rolling Mills](/en/inventions/rolling-mill).

## Operating principle

Slide bearings operate on the principle of **sliding friction** converted to **fluid friction**.

1.  **Surface Contact:** The shaft (journal) rests on the bearing surface.
2.  **Lubrication:** A lubricant (oil, grease, or fat) is introduced between the surfaces.
3.  **Hydrodynamic Wedge:** As the shaft rotates, it drags the lubricant into the load zone, creating a high-pressure wedge of fluid that lifts the shaft off the bearing surface. This prevents metal-to-metal contact and significantly reduces wear.

## How to create it

1.  **Material Selection:** Choose a material that is softer than the shaft. If the lubrication fails, the bearing should wear out, not the expensive shaft. Common choices include [Bronze](/en/materials/bronze), [Brass](/en/materials/brass), or dense, oily [Wood](/en/materials/wood).
2.  **Fabrication:**
    - **Bushing:** Create a cylindrical sleeve that fits tightly into the housing and has a smooth internal bore for the shaft.
    - **Split Bearing:** For easier assembly on long shafts (like crankshafts), make the bearing in two halves (top and bottom) that bolt together.
3.  **Fitting:** The internal diameter must be slightly larger than the shaft to allow space for the lubricant (clearance).
4.  **Grooving:** Cut small channels (oil grooves) into the inner surface to distribute the lubricant evenly.
5.  **Lubrication:** Ensure a continuous supply of [Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat) or [Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Bearing Material:** [Bronze](/en/materials/bronze), [Brass](/en/materials/brass), [Lead](/en/materials/lead) alloys (Babbitt), or hard [Wood](/en/materials/wood) (like Lignum Vitae).
  - **Lubricant:** [Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat), [Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil), or mineral oil.
- **Housing:** [Iron](/en/materials/iron) or [Steel](/en/materials/steel) to hold the bearing.
- **Tools:** Lathe (for precision), files, scrapers (for hand-fitting).

## Variants and improvements

- **Solid Bushing:** A simple one-piece tube.
- **Split Bearing (Plummer Block):** Two-piece housing allowing removal without disassembling the whole shaft.
- **Self-Lubricating:** Sintered bronze impregnated with oil (modern).
- **Thrust Bearing:** A flat surface to support axial loads (preventing the shaft from moving lengthwise).
- **Babbitt Bearing:** A cast iron shell lined with a soft lead-tin alloy (Babbitt) which has excellent anti-friction properties.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction at Start-up:** High friction occurs when starting and stopping because the fluid wedge hasn't formed yet.
- **Lubrication Dependence:** If the oil supply fails, the bearing will overheat and seize rapidly.
- **Heat Generation:** Fluid friction generates heat, which must be dissipated.
- **Maintenance:** Requires regular checking of oil levels and clearance.
