# Brief description

A pump is a mechanical device designed to move fluids (liquids or gases) from one place to another, typically by raising them from a lower elevation to a higher one.

## Use / Function

- **Water Supply:** Drawing water from wells for drinking or irrigation.
- **Drainage:** Removing water from flooded areas (mines, polders, ships).
- **Firefighting:** Projecting water to extinguish fires.
- **Industrial:** Moving liquids in processing (e.g., brine, oils).
- **Scale:** Domestic / Industrial.

## Operating principle

Pumps typically use energy to create a pressure difference (suction or positive pressure).
1.  **Suction:** Creating a partial vacuum so atmospheric pressure pushes the fluid into the chamber.
2.  **Displacement:** Physically pushing the fluid out of the chamber.
3.  **Check Valves:** Flaps that allow flow in only one direction, preventing backflow.

## How to create it

**Simple Piston Pump:**
1.  **Cylinder:** A hollow tube (wood or metal).
2.  **Piston:** A plug that fits tightly inside the cylinder (often wrapped in leather for a seal).
3.  **Valves:** Two one-way valves (leather flaps). One at the inlet (bottom) and one on the piston itself.
4.  **Mechanism:** A handle or lever to move the piston up and down.
    - *Upstroke:* Inlet valve opens, water is sucked in. Piston valve closes.
    - *Downstroke:* Inlet valve closes, piston valve opens, allowing water to pass above the piston.
    - *Next Upstroke:* Lifts the water above the piston to the spout while sucking in new water below.

## Materials needed

- **Body:** Hollowed log or cast metal pipe.
- **Piston:** Wood or metal plug.
- **Seals:** **Leather** or greasy rags to ensure an airtight fit.
- **Valves:** **Leather** flaps or simple ball valves (stone/metal ball).
- **Lubricant:** **Animal fat** to reduce friction and improve the seal.

## Variants and improvements

- **Archimedes' Screw:** A screw inside a pipe; excellent for lifting water short distances (e.g., irrigation) without complex valves. Can be driven by a windmill.
- **Chain Pump:** A continuous chain with buckets or discs pulling water up a tube.
- **Force Pump:** Uses a solid piston to push water out under pressure (good for firefighting).
- **Rope Pump:** Simple low-tech version using a rope and washers.

## Limits and risks

- **Suction Limit:** A suction pump can only lift water about 10 meters (33 feet) due to atmospheric pressure limits.
- **Leakage:** Poor seals reduce efficiency drastically.
- **Priming:** Often needs water poured in first to wet the seals and start the suction.
- **Freezing:** Water remaining in the pump can freeze and crack the body.
