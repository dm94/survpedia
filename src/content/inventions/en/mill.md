# Brief description

A mill is a mechanical device designed to crush, grind, or pulverize solid materials, mainly cereals, using motive power.

## Use / Function

- **Food:** Transformation of grain into flour.
- **Industry:** Crushing minerals or pigments.
- **Pressing:** Extracting oils from olives or seeds.
- **Pumping:** Some mills are adapted to raise water.

## Operating principle

It harnesses a power source (human, animal, wind, or hydraulic) to rotate a moving part (upper millstone) over a fixed part (lower millstone). The material introduced between them is crushed by friction and weight.

## How to create it

1. Carving two circular stones (millstones) with grooves to facilitate product output.
2. Construction of a wooden structure to support the shaft and transmission mechanism.
3. Installation of a feeding system (hopper) for the grain.

## Materials needed

- **Millstones:** Hard and rough stone such as granite or basalt.
- **Shafts and gears:** Strong wood (oak, holm oak) or metal.
- **Structure:** Wood for the frame and blades/wheels.

## Variants and improvements

- **Hand mill:** Manually operated, domestic scale.
- **Watermill:** Uses the power of rivers.
- **Windmill:** Uses wind energy.
- **Electric mill:** High-efficiency modern version.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance:** Stones lose roughness and must be periodically "dressed" or "pecked".
- **Safety:** Risk of entanglement in gears or stones.
- **Dependence:** Windmills or watermills depend on weather conditions.
