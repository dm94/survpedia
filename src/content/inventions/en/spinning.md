# Brief description

Spinning is the process of twisting aligned fibers into continuous yarn or thread for weaving, knitting, and sewing.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Convert loose fibers into strong, continuous yarn or thread.
- **Secondary uses**: Control yarn thickness, add twist for durability, and ply multiple strands.
- **Scale**: Individual to workshop.

## Operating principle

Spinning relies on **twist** and **drafting**.

1. **Preparation**: Fibers are cleaned and aligned.
2. **Drafting**: The spinner pulls fibers to a consistent thickness.
3. **Twist**: Rotation binds fibers together into a stable strand.
4. **Winding**: The finished yarn is wound for storage and use.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Hand Spindle)

1. **Align fibers**: Card or comb fibers into a loose bundle.
2. **Attach lead**: Tie or twist fibers onto a spindle.
3. **Spin**: Rotate the spindle to add twist while drafting.
4. **Wind**: Wrap the yarn onto the spindle shaft and repeat.

### Technical level

Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Linen](/en/materials/linen)**, **[Wool](/en/materials/wool)**, or **[Silk](/en/materials/silk)**.
- **Tools**:
  - **[Spindle](/en/inventions/spindle)** or **[Spinning Wheel](/en/inventions/spinning-wheel)**.
  - Carders/combs for fiber alignment.
  - Distaff or stick for holding prepared fiber.
- **Possible substitutes**:
  - Hand-rolling fibers on the thigh for short lengths.
  - Simple weighted stick as an improvised spindle.

## Variants and improvements

- **Drop spindle**: Portable and simple, good for most fibers.
- **Supported spindle**: Better for short or delicate fibers like cotton.
- **Spinning wheel**: Faster production with less fatigue.
- **Plying**: Twisting multiple yarns together for strength.
- **Wet spinning**: Helps smooth flax and other bast fibers.

## Limits and risks

- **Consistency**: Uneven drafting causes weak spots and breakage.
- **Contamination**: Dirt and seed fragments create snags.
- **Strain**: Repetitive motion can cause hand and shoulder fatigue.
- **Dust**: Fiber dust can irritate lungs over long periods.
