# Brief description

A durable road surface made of rounded river stones (cobbles) or roughly shaped stones embedded in sand or mortar. It provides a hard, all-weather surface for heavy traffic and drainage.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Transportation of people, animals, and carts on a durable surface that does not turn to mud.
- **Secondary uses:** Urban paving, preventing soil erosion, defining city streets.
- **Scale:** From garden paths to city streets and highways.

## Operating principle

- **Interlocking:** The stones are placed close together so they support each other.
- **Friction:** The texture provides grip for hooves and wheels.
- **Drainage:** Gaps between stones (often filled with sand) allow water to drain, or the camber sheds water to the sides.
- **Load Transfer:** The stones transfer heavy point loads from wheels to the softer base below without sinking.

## How to create it

1.  **Preparation:** Excavate the soil to a stable depth (remove topsoil).
2.  **Base:** Lay a bed of crushed stone or gravel for drainage and stability. Compact it well with a rammer.
3.  **Bedding:** Spread a layer of coarse sand or grit (about 5-10 cm).
4.  **Selection:** Select stones of similar size (cobbles) or shape (setts).
5.  **Laying:** Place stones upright (standing on end) into the sand bed, packing them tightly together. Use a hammer to tap them into place.
6.  **Ramming:** Use a heavy rammer to pound the stones down into the bedding until they are level.
7.  **Grouting:** Sweep fine sand or gravel into the joints between stones. Water it in to settle it. Repeat until joints are full.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **[Stones](/en/materials/stone):** River cobbles (rounded) or quarried setts (roughly cubic).
  - **[Sand](/en/materials/sand):** For the bedding layer.
  - **[Gravel](/en/materials/gravel):** For the sub-base drainage.
- **Tools:**
  - **[Pickaxe](/en/inventions/pickaxe) & [Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel):** For excavation.
  - **[Rammer](/en/inventions/rammer):** For compacting the base and the stones.
  - **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)/Mallet:** For setting individual stones.
  - **Broom:** For sweeping sand into joints.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dry Stone Paving:** Stones set in sand/earth (permeable).
- **Mortared Paving:** Stones set in [lime](/en/materials/lime) or [cement](/en/materials/cement) [mortar](/en/materials/mortar) (impermeable, stronger).
- **Belgian Block:** Using rectangular dressed stones (setts) for a smoother ride than rounded cobbles.
- **Patterned Paving:** Arranging stones in fans or arcs (bogan) for strength and aesthetics.

## Limits and risks

- **Noise/Vibration:** Can be very noisy and rough for wheeled vehicles compared to [asphalt](/en/materials/asphalt).
- **Slippery when wet:** Smooth river stones can be slippery for horses or pedestrians.
- **Maintenance:** Weeds can grow in sand joints; stones can loosen if the base washes away.
- **Labor:** Extremely labor-intensive to lay stone by stone.
