# Brief description

A collection of essential instruments designed to perform minor surgical procedures, such as suturing wounds, removing foreign bodies, and draining abscesses.

## Use / Function

- **Suturing**: Closing open wounds to promote healing and prevent infection.
- **Debridement**: Removing dead or infected tissue.
- **Extraction**: Removing bullets, splinters, or other foreign objects.
- **Hemostasis**: Stopping bleeding.

## Operating principle

Each instrument has a specific mechanical function:

- **Cutting**: Scalpels and scissors sever tissue.
- **Grasping**: Forceps hold tissue or needles without crushing them.
- **Retracting**: Retractors hold the wound open for visibility.

## How to create it

A basic kit should include at least:

1.  **Scalpel**: For incisions.
2.  **Surgical Scissors**: For cutting tissue and thread (Mayo or Metzenbaum).
3.  **Forceps**: For holding tissue (Adson) or clamping blood vessels (Hemostats).
4.  **Needle Holder**: To drive the needle through tough tissue.
5.  **Suture Material**: Needle and thread.

## Materials needed

- **Stainless Steel**: For all metal instruments (rust resistance and ability to be sterilized).
- **Sterilization equipment**: Boiling water, alcohol, or autoclave.

## Variants and improvements

- **Field Kit**: Minimalist, rugged, often includes disposables.
- **Operating Room Set**: Comprehensive, high-quality steel, reusable.
- **Improvised**: Razor blades, sewing needles, fishing line (high infection risk).

## Limits and risks

- **Sterility**: The biggest risk is infection. Instruments must be sterilized before use.
- **Skill**: Possessing the tools does not grant the skill to use them. Improper use can cause fatal damage (severing arteries/nerves).
