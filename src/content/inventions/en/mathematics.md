# Brief description

Mathematics is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space. It usually begins with counting and measuring, evolving into a system for understanding shapes, patterns, and change. It is the language of science and engineering.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to model reality to solve problems:

-   **Trade and Accounting:** Tracking inventory, debts, and currency.
-   **Construction:** Calculating areas, volumes, and structural loads (Geometry).
-   **Astronomy/Navigation:** Predicting celestial positions and determining location on Earth.
-   **Timekeeping:** Creating accurate calendars.

## Operating principle

Mathematics operates on **abstraction** and **logic**:

1.  **Abstraction:** Converting real-world objects (3 apples) into symbols (the number 3).
2.  **Operations:** Manipulating these symbols according to logical rules (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
3.  **Proof:** Verifying that a statement is true based on previously established truths (axioms).

## How to create it

1.  **Counting (Arithmetic):**
    -   Start with **one-to-one correspondence** (e.g., one finger per sheep).
    -   Use **tally marks** or tokens (stones) to represent larger quantities.
    -   Develop a **number system** (base-10 is common due to fingers, base-60 was used by Babylonians).
    -   Invent **place value** (a zero symbol) to handle large numbers efficiently.

2.  **Measuring (Geometry):**
    -   Use a standard length (rope) to measure fields.
    -   Discover relationships: The 3-4-5 triangle creates a perfect right angle (essential for building).
    -   Calculate Pi ($\pi$) by measuring the circumference and diameter of circles.

## Materials needed

-   **Recording Surfaces:**
    -   **Sand/Dust:** For temporary calculations and geometric diagrams (used by Archimedes).
    -   **Clay/Wax Tablets:** For erasable or permanent records.
    -   **Paper/Papyrus:** For complex calculations.
-   **Tools:**
    -   **Abacus:** A frame with beads for performing arithmetic.
    -   **Rope/Compass:** For drawing circles and straight lines.
    -   **Straightedge:** For drawing lines.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Abacus/Suanpan:** Mechanical aids for calculation.
-   **Algebra:** Solving for unknown values using symbols.
-   **Calculus:** Mathematics of change (motion, growth).
-   **Statistics:** Analyzing data and probability.

## Limits and risks

-   **Abstractness:** Math is a model, not reality. A correct calculation can describe an impossible physical situation.
-   **Error Propagation:** A small mistake at the beginning of a calculation grows into a large error.
-   **Complexity:** Advanced math requires years of study and specialized notation.
