# Brief description

A drill bit is a cutting tool used to remove material to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. Drill bits come in many sizes and shapes and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials.

## Use / Function

The primary use of a drill bit is to cut holes in solid materials.

- **Primary use**: Drilling holes in wood, metal, plastic, and stone.
- **Secondary uses**: Reaming (enlarging existing holes), countersinking.
- **Scale**: Used in everything from delicate jewelry making to massive industrial mining operations.

## Operating principle

The drill bit acts as a rotating cutting edge.

- **Rotation**: The bit is rotated by a drill (**[Hand Drill](/en/inventions/hand-drill)** or **[Drill Press](/en/inventions/drill-press)**).
- **Axial Force**: Pressure is applied along the axis of the bit into the work material.
- **Shearing/Chipping**: The cutting edges of the bit shear off material (in metal/wood) or chip it away (in stone), while the flutes (grooves) help evacuate the debris (chips/dust) from the hole.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

A simple hard stone (**[Flint](/en/materials/flint)**) flake with a sharp point can serve as a primitive drill bit for softer materials like wood or bone.

### Intermediate version

A metal rod (**[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**, **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)**, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**) flattened at the tip and sharpened into a spear-point shape.

### Advanced version

Twist drills made of hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[High Speed Steel](/en/materials/steel)**. This requires:

1.  Forging a steel rod.
2.  Twisting it while hot to create flutes (for chip removal).
3.  Hardening and tempering the steel to hold an edge without shattering.
4.  Sharpening the tip to the correct cutting angle.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: Hard material (Flint, Obsidian, Copper, Bronze, Iron, Steel).
- **Tools**: **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**, **[Anvil](/en/inventions/anvil)**, **[Files](/en/inventions/file)** (for shaping metal), **[Grinding Wheel](/en/inventions/grinding-wheel)** (for sharpening).

## Variants and improvements

- **Spoon bit**: An early type of bit shaped like a gouge, good for wood.
- **Twist bit**: The modern standard, with helical flutes to remove chips.
- **Masonry bit**: Has a **[Tungsten Carbide](/en/materials/tungsten)** tip for drilling into stone or concrete.
- **Auger**: A large wood-boring bit with a screw tip to pull itself into the wood.

## Limits and risks

- **Overheating**: Friction generates heat, which can ruin the temper of a steel bit or burn the material being drilled. Use lubricant (water, oil).
- **Breaking**: Bits are hard but brittle. Lateral force can snap them.
- **Jamming**: If chips are not cleared, the bit can get stuck.
