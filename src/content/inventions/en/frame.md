# Brief description

A **Frame** is the rigid structural skeleton of a building, vehicle, or object that provides shape and support. In construction, it carries the weight of the roof, floors, and walls, transferring these loads to the foundation.

## Use / Function

- **Structural Support:** Bears the dead load (weight of materials) and live load (people, furniture, snow, wind).
- **Shape Definition:** Determines the form and volume of the structure.
- **Mounting Surface:** Provides a stable base for attaching cladding, roofing, and interior finishes.
- **Space Creation:** Allows for open interior spaces by bridging gaps between supports.

## Operating principle

The frame works by **load transfer** and **structural rigidity**.

1.  **Load Path:** Gravity pulls down on the roof and floors. The frame (rafters, joists, beams) collects this load and transfers it horizontally to vertical supports (posts, columns, studs).
2.  **Vertical Transfer:** The vertical supports carry the load down to the **[Foundation](/en/inventions/foundation)**.
3.  **Rigidity:** The frame must resist deformation from lateral forces (wind, earthquakes) using bracing or shear walls. Triangulation (as in a **[Truss](/en/inventions/truss)**) is often used for stability.

## How to create it

1.  **Design:** Determine the span and loads to select the right material and member size.
2.  **Preparation:** Cut members to length (posts, beams, rafters).
3.  **Layout:** Mark the positions of walls and openings on the foundation.
4.  **Assembly (Wall/Floor):**
    - **Sill Plate:** Anchor the bottom plate to the foundation.
    - **Studs/Posts:** Erect vertical members at regular intervals.
    - **Top Plate/Beam:** Connect the tops of the vertical members to distribute the load.
5.  **Assembly (Roof):**
    - **Rafters/Trusses:** Install the roof frame on top of the walls to support the **[Roofing](/en/inventions/roofing)**.
6.  **Bracing:** Install diagonal braces or sheathing to prevent the frame from racking (leaning).
7.  **Fastening:** Secure all connections with nails, screws, bolts, or joinery.

## Materials needed

- **Structural Members:**
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Lumber, timber, or engineered wood.
  - **[Steel](/en/materials/steel):** Beams, columns, or light gauge studs.
  - **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete):** Reinforced columns and beams.
- **Fasteners:** Nails, screws, bolts, plates, or welding (for metal).
- **Tools:** **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**, **[Saw](/en/inventions/saw)**, **[Level](/en/inventions/level)**, **[Drill](/en/inventions/hand-drill)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Timber Framing:** Uses heavy timbers and traditional joinery (mortise and tenon).
- **Balloon Framing:** Uses long continuous studs from foundation to roof (older method, fire risk).
- **Platform Framing:** Builds one floor at a time (most common modern wood method).
- **Steel Framing:** Uses steel columns and beams for high-rise or industrial buildings.
- **[Truss](/en/inventions/truss):** A triangulated frame component used for long spans.

## Limits and risks

- **Rot/Decay:** Wood frames are susceptible to moisture and insects (termites).
- **Fire:** Wood frames are combustible; steel loses strength in high heat.
- **Collapse:** Poor design or overloading can lead to structural failure.
- **Thermal Bridging:** Frames can conduct heat/cold, reducing insulation efficiency.
