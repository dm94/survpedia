# Brief description

An ultra-high precision mechanical clock designed specifically to work at sea. Its main purpose is to allow navigators to determine geographical longitude by measuring the exact time at a reference meridian (such as Greenwich).

## Use / Function

- **Navigation:** Determine longitude by comparing local time (solar) with chronometer time (home port time).
- **Expeditions:** Precise mapping of coastlines and islands.

## Operating principle

Works like a refined mechanical watch but solves critical sea problems:

1. **Balance Wheel:** Replaces the pendulum (which doesn't work on a moving ship).
2. **Gimbal Suspension:** Keeps the clock level regardless of the ship's roll.
3. **Thermal Compensation:** Uses bimetallic strips in the balance wheel to adjust its shape and maintain a constant period under temperature changes.
4. **Constant Force:** A mechanism (fusee) equalizes the mainspring's force as it unwinds.

## How to create it

1. **Mechanism:** Similar to a pocket watch but larger and more robust.
2. **Box:** A wooden box with brass suspension (gimbals).
3. **Adjustment:** Requires months of calibration and testing at different temperatures.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Brass (corrosion resistant), Steel (springs), Glass (cover), Wood (protective box).
- **Tools:** Maximum precision watchmaking tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Atomic Clock:** Modern successor, based on atom frequency (Cesium, Rubidium).
- **Quartz Clock:** Common electronic version today.

## Limits and risks

- **Cost:** Historically extremely expensive and difficult to manufacture.
- **Maintenance:** Requires specialized cleaning and oiling.
- Cumulative Error: Even the best mechanical chronometer has a small drift that must be accounted for.
