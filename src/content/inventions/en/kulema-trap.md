# Brief description

A Kulema trap is a boxed, spring-loaded snare designed to catch small predators when they pull bait through a narrow entrance.

## Use / Function

- **Predator control:** Reduce losses of poultry or stored food.
- **Fur capture:** Capture small carnivores for hides.
- **Targeted trapping:** Boxed entry reduces interference from birds.
- **Scale:** Individual hunter or homestead use.

## Operating principle

A baited trigger holds a spring frame or loop under tension. When the animal reaches into the box and tugs the bait, the trigger releases and the frame snaps closed around the neck or shoulders. The box guides the animal into a consistent position, improving reliability.

## How to create it

1. **Build the box:** Make a narrow tunnel box from **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** with one entry and a bait chamber at the back.
2. **Form the spring:** Shape a strong spring frame from **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**.
3. **Install the trigger:** Use a notched stick or toggle that holds the spring under tension.
4. **Add bait hook:** Tie a bait pin or hook with **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** thong.
5. **Set and anchor:** Compress the spring, engage the trigger, and anchor the box to a tree or stake.

Technical level: Intermediate woodworking and safe spring handling.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for the box, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** for the spring frame, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** for lashings.
- **Tools:** Knife, saw, drill or awl, pliers.
- **Substitutes:** Bent green sapling as spring, bone peg as trigger, rawhide lashings.

## Variants and improvements

- **Tree-set box:** Mounted on a trunk to target climbing animals.
- **Ground-set box:** Wider entry and heavier anchoring for larger targets.
- **Safety baffle:** Extra slats to limit access by non-target species.
- **Weather cover:** Shingled top to keep snow and rain out.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Can harm pets or protected wildlife.
- **Handler injury:** Spring frames can snap on hands if mishandled.
- **Trap-shy animals:** Repeated exposure reduces effectiveness.
- **Legal limits:** Many regions restrict lethal trapping methods.
