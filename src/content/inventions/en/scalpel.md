# Brief description

A scalpel is a small and extremely sharp bladed instrument used for surgery, anatomical dissection, and various arts and crafts.

## Use / Function

- **Incisions**: Making precise cuts in skin and tissue.
- **Dissection**: Separating tissues.

## Operating principle

Applies high pressure on a very small area (the edge) to sever molecular bonds of the material being cut.

## How to create it

- **Modern**: Disposable steel blade attached to a reusable handle.
- **Primitive**: Knapping obsidian or flint to an ultra-sharp edge (sharper than steel but brittle).

## Materials needed

- **High-Carbon Steel**: For the blade (holds edge well).
- **Stainless Steel**: For the handle (corrosion resistance).
- **Obsidian**: For primitive, ultra-sharp blades.

## Variants and improvements

- **Disposable**: Pre-sterilized, single-use blades.
- **Laser**: Uses light to cut and cauterize simultaneously.
- **Obsidian**: Used in some modern surgeries for minimal scarring due to its atomic-level edge.

## Limits and risks

- **Dulling**: Steel dulls relatively quickly compared to diamond, but is easy to resharpen or replace.
- **Injury**: Extremely dangerous if mishandled.
