# Brief description

A mechanical device that controls the flow of a fluid (liquid, gas, or slurry) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Stopping and starting water flow in **[Pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)**.
- **Secondary uses:** Regulating pressure, preventing backflow (check valves), safety release (relief valves).
- **Scale:** Tiny (bicycle tire) to massive (dam sluice gates).

## Operating principle

- **Obstruction:** A movable element (gate, ball, disc, plug) is moved into or out of the stream.
- **Actuation:** A handle, wheel, or lever applies force to move the element against the fluid pressure.
- **Sealing:** Soft materials (**[Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)**, leather) or precise metal-to-metal contact prevent leaks when closed.

## How to create it

1.  **Body:** Cast a metal or plastic housing with an inlet and outlet.
2.  **Bonnet/Cap:** The cover that allows access to internal parts.
3.  **Trim:** The moving parts (stem, seat, disc).
4.  **Assembly:** Fit the disc to the stem, insert into the body, and ensure the seat is smooth.
5.  **Packing:** Wrap the stem with greased rope or rubber to prevent leaks around the handle.

## Materials needed

- **Body:** **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)** (corrosion resistant), **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** (strong), **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)**.
- **Seals:** **[Natural Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)**, Leather washers.
- **Lubricant:** Grease or animal fat.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gate Valve:** A wedge moves up/down. Good for on/off, bad for throttling.
- **Ball Valve:** A sphere with a hole rotates 90 degrees. Fast and reliable.
- **Check Valve:** Allows flow in only one direction (automatic). Essential for pumps.
- **Butterfly Valve:** A disc rotates on a shaft. Compact for large pipes.

## Limits and risks

- **Water Hammer:** Closing a valve too fast stops water instantly, creating a shockwave that can burst pipes.
- **Leaking:** Seats wear out over time.
- **Corrosion:** Stuck valves are common in old systems.
- **Pressure:** Must be rated for the system's pressure or it will burst.
