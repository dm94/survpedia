# Brief description

An electric motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It is the reverse of an electric generator and is fundamental for powering machinery, vehicles, and tools using electricity.

## Use / Function

- **Mechanical Power:** Driving pumps, fans, tools, and vehicles.
- **Automation:** Enabling automated movement in machinery.
- **Efficiency:** Converting electricity into work with high efficiency compared to heat engines.

## Operating principle

It operates on the Lorentz force principle. When an electric current flows through a wire coil placed in a magnetic field, a force is exerted on the wire, causing it to move. By arranging the coil on a shaft (rotor) and alternating the current direction with a commutator, continuous rotation is achieved.

## How to create it

1.  **Stator:** Create a stationary magnetic field using permanent magnets (magnetite/steel) or electromagnets (coils on iron cores).
2.  **Rotor (Armature):** Wind copper wire around a shaft or iron core to form the spinning coil.
3.  **Commutator (for DC):** Attach split metal rings to the shaft, insulated from each other. Connect the coil ends to these rings.
4.  **Brushes:** Use conductive brushes (carbon or copper strips) to slide against the commutator and supply current to the spinning coil.
5.  **Assembly:** Mount the rotor inside the stator so it can spin freely.
6.  **Power:** Connect a battery or DC source to the brushes.

## Materials needed

- **Copper Wire:** For the coils (low resistance is crucial).
- **Magnets:** Permanent magnets or electromagnets.
- **Iron/Steel:** For the core to concentrate magnetic flux and for the shaft.
- **Conductive strips:** For the commutator and brushes.
- **Insulation:** Varnish or fabric for the wire.

## Variants and improvements

- **DC Motor:** Simple, easy to control speed with voltage. Requires commutator.
- **AC Motor:** Uses alternating current. Induction motors are very durable (no brushes).
- **Universal Motor:** Can run on AC or DC (series wound).
- **Brushless DC:** Electronic commutation, high efficiency and reliability (requires electronics).

## Limits and risks

- **Overheating:** High currents generate heat (Joule effect) which can melt insulation.
- **Wear:** Brushes and commutator wear out mechanically and spark.
- **Torque/Speed:** Different designs trade off torque vs speed.
- **Short Circuits:** Poor insulation can cause failure.
