# Brief description

A shallow trough or channel designed to collect and carry away water, typically found at the side of a road or the edge of a roof.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** **[Road](/en/inventions/road)** drainage to prevent water accumulation that could wash away the road base or cause hydroplaning.
- **Secondary uses:** Roof drainage (protecting foundations from water damage), irrigation channels.
- **Scale:** From small residential paths to major highways.

## Operating principle

- **Gravity Flow:** Gutters rely on a slight downward slope (gradient) to move water from high points to discharge areas (drains, soakaways, or natural waterways).
- **Containment:** The channel shape keeps water confined, preventing it from spreading over the road surface or eroding the surrounding soil.

## How to create it

### Road Gutter (Basic)

1.  **Survey:** Determine the slope and direction of water flow alongside the **[road](/en/inventions/road)**.
2.  **Excavation:** Dig a trench parallel to the road using **[shovels](/en/inventions/shovel)** and **[pickaxes](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**.
3.  **Shaping:** Shape the trench (V-shaped or U-shaped) to facilitate flow.
4.  **Lining (Optional but recommended):** Line with **[stones](/en/materials/stone)**, **[concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, or compacted earth to prevent erosion and improve flow.

### Roof Gutter (Advanced)

1.  **Fabrication:** Form channels from **[metal](/en/materials/metal)**, **[wood](/en/materials/wood)** (lined), or **[plastic](/en/materials/plastic)**.
2.  **Installation:** Attach to the roof eaves with a slight slope towards a downspout.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)**, **[Pickaxe](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**.
- **Lining:** **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** (cobbles), **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, or simply compacted earth.
- **Roof Gutters:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**, **[Zinc](/en/materials/zinc)**, or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Earth Ditch:** Simple unlined trench (prone to erosion/clogging).
- **Lined Gutter:** Stone or concrete lining for durability and smoother flow.
- **Box Gutter:** Rectangular gutter built into a roof structure.
- **Curb and Gutter:** Modern concrete combination defining the road edge and carrying water.

## Limits and risks

- **Clogging:** Accumulation of leaves, dirt, and debris can block flow, causing overflow.
- **Erosion:** High-speed water flow can erode unlined gutters.
- **Stagnation:** Poor slope leads to standing water, breeding mosquitoes and causing smells.
