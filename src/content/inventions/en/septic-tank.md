# Brief description

A localized underground wastewater treatment system for areas not connected to a central **[Sewage System](/en/inventions/sewage-system)**. It uses natural processes (settling and anaerobic bacteria) to treat sewage before releasing it into a drain field.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Treating household wastewater (from toilets, sinks, showers).
- **Secondary uses**: Separating solids from liquids.
- **Scale**: Single household to small community.

## Operating principle

1.  **Settling**: Wastewater flows into the tank. Heavy solids (sludge) sink to the bottom. Lighter solids (grease, oil - scum) float to the top.
2.  **Anaerobic Digestion**: Bacteria in the tank break down the organic matter in the sludge and scum, reducing their volume.
3.  **Effluent**: The liquid layer in the middle (effluent) flows out of the tank into a drain field.
4.  **Filtration**: The drain field (perforated pipes in gravel) distributes the effluent into the soil, where aerobic bacteria further treat it before it reaches groundwater.

## How to create it

### 1. The Tank
- Must be watertight to prevent leakage and groundwater infiltration.
- **Inlet**: Where sewage enters. Has a baffle to prevent disturbing the scum layer.
- **Outlet**: Where effluent leaves. Has a baffle or filter to prevent solids from clogging the drain field.
- **Access Ports**: Lids for inspection and pumping out sludge (every 3-5 years).

### 2. The Drain Field (Leach Field)
- A network of **[Pipes](/en/inventions/pipes)** with holes, laid in trenches filled with gravel.
- The soil must be permeable (perc test required).

## Materials needed

- **Tank**: **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** (precast or poured), **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** (polyethylene), **[Fiberglass](/en/materials/fiberglass)**, or **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** (historical, sealed with mortar).
- **Pipes**: **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** (PVC) for connections and perforated drain lines.
- **Gravel/Stone**: For the drain field bed.
- **Soil**: The final filter.

## Variants and improvements

- **Aerobic Treatment Unit (ATU)**: Uses an air pump to inject oxygen, promoting aerobic bacteria which digest waste faster and cleaner than anaerobic ones.
- **Mound System**: An elevated drain field for areas with high water tables or shallow bedrock.
- **Sand Filter**: Effluent passes through a bed of sand before entering the soil.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance**: Sludge builds up and MUST be pumped out regularly (3-5 years) or it will clog the drain field (expensive failure).
- **Chemicals**: Bleach, harsh cleaners, and paints kill the beneficial bacteria, stopping the treatment process.
- **Groundwater Contamination**: If the soil is too permeable or the water table is too high, untreated sewage can pollute drinking water wells.
- **Capacity**: Cannot handle massive surges of water (e.g., stormwater) without flushing out solids.
