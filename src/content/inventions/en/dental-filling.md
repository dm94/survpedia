# Brief description

A dental filling is a material placed into a cavity or fracture to seal the tooth, reduce pain, and restore chewing shape while blocking food and bacteria.

## Use / Function

It restores damaged teeth:

- **Sealing**: Closes cavities and cracks to slow decay.
- **Protection**: Covers exposed dentin and reduces sensitivity.
- **Function**: Restores chewing surfaces.
- **Hygiene**: Prevents debris from getting trapped.
- **Scale**: Individual treatments, from temporary to longer-lasting.

## Operating principle

The filling removes softened or contaminated tissue, cleans the cavity, and seals it with a compacted or bonding material. The seal reduces bacterial entry, spreads bite pressure, and protects dentin. Final shaping avoids bite interference.

## How to create it

1. **Clean and inspect**: Rinse with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and check with a **[Mirror](/en/inventions/mirror)**.
2. **Remove soft tissue**: Use **[Surgery Tools](/en/inventions/surgery-tools)** to clear decayed material without going too deep.
3. **Disinfect and dry**: Clean with **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** and dry with **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
4. **Prepare the filler**:
   - **Temporary**: Mix **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** with a small amount of **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**.
   - **Tougher**: Fine fired **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** powder mixed with resin.
   - **Metal**: Simple **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)** or **[Tin](/en/materials/tin)** inlay if it can be fitted.
5. **Place and adjust**: Pack the material, smooth edges with a **[File](/en/inventions/file)**, and check the bite.
6. **Aftercare**: Wash with **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)** and keep gentle brushing.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)**, **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**, **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)**.
- **Optional reinforcement**: **[Silver](/en/materials/silver)**, **[Tin](/en/materials/tin)**, or **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)** for inlays.
- **Hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
- **Tools**: **[Mirror](/en/inventions/mirror)**, **[Surgery Tools](/en/inventions/surgery-tools)**, **[File](/en/inventions/file)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Temporary filling**: Wax and resin cover until better care is possible.
- **Mineral filling**: Fired clay powder with resin for higher hardness.
- **Metal inlay**: Small hammered pieces for longer durability.
- **Layered seal**: Thin resin layers with mineral powder for better fit.

## Limits and risks

- **Poor seal**: Can allow decay under the filling.
- **Pulp damage**: Deep cavities may cause lingering pain.
- **Fracture**: Brittle materials can crack under hard bites.
- **Contamination**: Inadequate cleaning increases infection risk.
