# Brief description

An excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Accessing groundwater (aquifers) for drinking and irrigation.
- **Secondary uses:** Storage (stepwells), refrigeration (keeping food cool).
- **Scale:** Household to village.

## Operating principle

- **Water Table:** The hole penetrates the ground until it reaches the zone of saturation where water fills the spaces between soil particles or rock fractures.
- **Seepage:** Groundwater seeps into the well cavity, filling it to the level of the water table.
- **Extraction:** Water is lifted via bucket, pump, or pressure (artesian).

## How to create it

1.  **Location:** Look for signs of water (green vegetation in dry areas, animal tracks, dowsing).
2.  **Digging:** Excavate a shaft. Ensure the diameter is large enough to work in but small enough to be stable.
3.  **Lining (Casing):** As you dig deeper, line the walls with **[stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[brick](/en/materials/brick)**, or wood to prevent collapse and keep surface contaminants out.
4.  **Completion:** Dig past the water table level to ensure supply during dry seasons.
5.  **Protection:** Build a wall (parapet) above ground and a cover to prevent animals/debris from falling in.

## Materials needed

- **Lining:** **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** rings, or rot-resistant **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**.
- **Tools:** **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)**, **[Pickaxe](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**, **[Rope](/en/materials/rope)** and buckets for removing soil.
- **Extraction:** **[Rope](/en/materials/rope)** and **[Pulley](/en/inventions/pulley)**, or a **[Pump](/en/inventions/pump)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dug Well:** Hand-dug, large diameter, shallow.
- **Driven Well:** A pipe with a pointed screen is driven into soft ground. Good for shallow sand aquifers.
- **Drilled Well:** Deep, narrow borehole made by machines. Reaches deep, clean aquifers.
- **Qanat:** A horizontal tunnel tapping into a hill's water table (ancient Persian technology).
- **Stepwell:** Large, architectural wells with stairs to reach the fluctuating water level.

## Limits and risks

- **Collapse:** Extremely dangerous to dig. Walls can cave in; gases (CO2, Methane) can accumulate.
- **Contamination:** Shallow wells are easily polluted by nearby latrines or livestock.
- **Drying Up:** If the water table drops (drought or over-extraction), the well runs dry.
- **Salinity:** In coastal areas, over-pumping can draw in saltwater.
