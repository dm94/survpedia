# Brief description

A device used to weave cloth and tapestry. It holds the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Weaving fabrics for clothing, blankets, sails, and containers.
- **Secondary uses**: Creating rugs, tapestries, and mats.
- **Scale**: Domestic to industrial.

## Operating Principle

The fundamental principle of the loom is to hold longitudinal threads (the warp) under tension so that transverse threads (the weft) can be inserted over and under them.

1. **Shedding**: Raising specific warp threads to create a space (shed).
2. **Picking**: Passing the weft thread through the shed.
3. **Beating-up**: Pushing the newly inserted weft thread against the woven fabric to compact it.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Backstrap Loom)

1. **Bars**: Two sturdy sticks or bars.
2. **Tension**: One bar is tied to a fixed object (tree, post), the other to a strap around the weaver's waist.
3. **Heddle**: A stick or loop string to lift alternate warp threads.
4. **Shuttle**: A stick with weft thread wrapped around it.

### Technical level

Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - Wood (for bars/frame).
  - Yarn/Thread (warp and weft).
  - Rope/Cord (for binding and tension).
- **Tools**:
  - Knife or Saw (to cut wood).
  - Smooth stick (shuttle).

## Variants and improvements

- **Backstrap Loom**: Portable, uses body weight for tension.
- **Warp-Weighted Loom**: Vertical, weights keep warp taut.
- **Floor Loom**: Horizontal frame with foot pedals (treadles) for faster operation.
- **Improvements**: Adding a reed (comb) to space threads evenly and beat the weft tighter.

## Limits and risks

- **Complexity**: Setting up the warp (warping) is time-consuming and requires precision.
- **Speed**: Simple looms are slow; complex patterns take time.
- **Physical strain**: Backstrap looms can be tiring for the back.
