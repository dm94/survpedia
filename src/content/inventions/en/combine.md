# Brief description

A combine harvester is a machine that performs reaping, threshing, and cleaning of grain in a single pass. It compresses multiple harvest steps into one operation, reducing labor and time across large fields.

## Use / Function

- **Harvesting grain:** Cuts standing crops and gathers the heads.
- **Threshing:** Separates grain from stalks and husks.
- **Cleaning:** Uses airflow and sieves to remove chaff.
- **Field efficiency:** Complements soil preparation from **[Plow and tools](/en/inventions/plow-tools)** by mechanizing harvest.
- **Scale:** Farm to regional agriculture.

## Operating principle

- **Cutting header:** A reciprocating knife and reel cut and feed crop into the machine.
- **Feeding system:** Augers and conveyors move material into the threshing drum.
- **Threshing drum and concave:** Impact and rubbing separate grain from straw.
- **Separation:** Straw walkers or rotors shake remaining grain free.
- **Cleaning shoe:** Fans and sieves blow away chaff while grain falls into a bin.

## How to create it

1. **Build a simple header:** A rigid bar with a cutting edge and reel to guide stalks.
2. **Add a threshing drum:** A rotating cylinder with bars against a curved concave.
3. **Create a winnowing section:** A fan with adjustable airflow and layered sieves.
4. **Power and drive:** Use animal, water, or engine power with belts and pulleys.
5. **Minimum functional version:** Reaper + small thresher + fan-driven cleaner.
6. **Technical level:** Advanced for full combine; intermediate for partial versions.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** frame and cutting parts, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** shafts and fasteners, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for platforms or housings.
- **Power and motion:** **[Natural rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)** belts, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** straps or padding.
- **Tools:** Forging tools, woodworking tools, drilling and alignment tools.
- **Substitutes:** Rope drive and wooden components for low-speed, animal-powered versions.

## Variants and improvements

- **Reaper-binder:** Cuts and bundles without threshing.
- **Stationary thresher:** Separate machine paired with manual reaping.
- **Self-propelled combine:** Engine-driven with onboard grain tank.
- **Rotary combine:** Improved separation and reduced grain loss.

## Limits and risks

- **Maintenance load:** Many moving parts require constant alignment and lubrication.
- **Losses:** Poor settings waste grain in straw or chaff.
- **Safety hazards:** Rotating drums and belts can cause severe injury.
- **Terrain limits:** Wet or uneven fields reduce performance and increase clogging.
