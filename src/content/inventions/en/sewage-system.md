# Brief description

A network of underground pipes and facilities dedicated to collecting and transporting wastewater and refuse from buildings to a treatment or disposal site.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Hygienic removal of human waste (sanitation) to prevent disease.
- **Secondary uses:** Drainage of stormwater to prevent flooding.
- **Scale:** Urban and industrial.

## Operating principle

- **Gravity Flow:** Sewers are laid on a precise downward slope so liquids flow naturally without pumping.
- **Traps:** U-shaped bends in pipes at inlets (sinks, toilets) hold a small amount of water to block sewer gases from entering buildings.
- **Venting:** Vertical pipes allow air to enter the system, preventing vacuums that would suck traps dry and ensuring smooth flow.

## How to create it

1.  **Surveying:** Determine the natural slope of the terrain towards a low point (river, treatment plant).
2.  **Trenching:** Dig trenches deep enough to ensure a constant gradient (usually 1-2%).
3.  **Laying Pipes:** Install large diameter pipes. Ensure joints are watertight to prevent groundwater contamination.
4.  **Manholes:** Install access points at regular intervals and every change of direction for cleaning and inspection.
5.  **Connections:** Connect building drains to the main sewer line.

## Materials needed

- **Pipes:** **[Ceramic](/en/materials/ceramics)** (glazed clay), **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[Plastic](/en/materials/plastic)** (PVC), or **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** (historical).
- **Structure:** **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** and **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** for manholes.
- **Tools:** **[Shovels](/en/inventions/shovel)**, **[Levels](/en/inventions/level)**, **[Pickaxes](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Combined Sewer:** Carries both sewage and stormwater. Cheaper to build but prone to overflowing raw sewage during heavy rains.
- **Separate Sewer:** Distinct systems for sanitary sewage and stormwater. More expensive but environmentally safer.
- **Septic System:** A local, on-site version for isolated buildings using a tank and leaching field.

## Limits and risks

- **Blockages:** Accumulation of grease, roots, or solid objects can cause backups.
- **Overflow:** Heavy rains can overwhelm combined systems.
- **Health Hazard:** Direct contact with sewage causes cholera, dysentery, and other diseases.
- **Gases:** Methane and hydrogen sulfide build up in sewers; they are toxic and explosive.
