# Brief description

A set of two simple tools used since the Stone Age to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder.

## Use / Function

- **Grinding:** Turning dried herbs, **[Spices](/en/materials/spices)**, or chemicals into powder.
- **Crushing:** Breaking down hard seeds or minerals.
- **Mixing:** Blending wet and dry ingredients (pastes, paints, medicines).
- **Scale:** Individual/Laboratory.

## Operating principle

It uses **compression** and **friction**. The bowl (mortar) holds the material, while the club (pestle) applies downward pressure and rotation to break the material against the hard walls of the bowl.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection**: Find a very hard material that won't chip into the food/medicine.
2.  **Hollowing**: Carve a bowl shape into a stone or hard wood block.
3.  **Shaping**: Create a smooth, rounded club (pestle) that fits comfortably in the hand and matches the curvature of the bowl.

## Materials needed

-   **Essential**: Hard stone (granite, basalt), hardwood, or fired ceramic.
-   **Tools**: Chisels, scrapers, or other stones for shaping.
-   **Possible substitutes**: A flat grinding stone and handstone, or a **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** for grains.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Stone Mortar**: Best for hard minerals and dry grinding.
-   **Wooden Mortar**: Good for large quantities of grain or soft herbs; lighter but harder to clean.
-   **Ceramic Mortar**: Smooth and easy to clean, good for medicines (apothecary).

## Limits and risks

-   **Contamination**: Poor quality mortars can shed material (sand/grit) into the mixture.
-   **Absorption**: Porous materials (wood, unglazed pottery) absorb flavors and chemicals, making cross-contamination a risk.
