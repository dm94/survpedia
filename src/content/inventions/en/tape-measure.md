# Brief description

A flexible ruler used to measure length or distance. It consists of a ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or metal strip with linear-measurement markings. It is a common measuring tool.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Measuring length, especially around curves or corners.
- **Secondary uses:** Drawing straight lines (if stiff enough), marking distances.
- **Scale:** Domestic to Industrial (construction, tailoring).

## Operating principle

Direct comparison against a calibrated scale printed on the tape. The flexibility allows it to conform to the shape of the object being measured. Retractable versions use a spring mechanism to coil the tape.

## How to create it

1.  **Tape Material:** Obtain a long, flexible strip of non-stretching material (fiberglass, metal, or treated fabric).
2.  **Marking:** Calibrate and mark measurement units (inches, centimeters) along the strip using a standard ruler.
3.  **Housing (Optional):** Create a case to hold the coiled tape.
4.  **Retraction Mechanism (Optional):** Attach the inner end of the tape to a spring-loaded spool.

- **Technical level:** Basic (simple tape) to Intermediate (retractable mechanism).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Flexible, non-stretch material (steel strip, fiberglass cloth), marking ink/paint.
- **Tools:** Cutting tools, calibration standard.
- **Substitutes:** A string or rope can be used to measure length and then compared against a ruler (indirect measurement).

## Variants and improvements

- **Tailor's Tape:** Soft fabric or plastic, used for body measurements.
- **Carpenter's Tape:** Stiff, curved metal strip that can extend without support (stand-out). Retractable.
- **Surveyor's Tape:** Long tapes (up to 100m) for land measurement, often on an open reel.
- **Laser Distance Meter:** Electronic alternative for long distances.

## Limits and risks

- **Stretching:** Fabric tapes may stretch over time, affecting accuracy.
- **Temperature:** Metal tapes expand/contract with temperature changes.
- **Sag:** Long tapes measuring distance in the air will sag (catenary curve), requiring tension correction.
- **Sharp Edges:** Metal tapes can cut skin if retracted too quickly.
