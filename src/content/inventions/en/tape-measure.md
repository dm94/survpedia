# Brief description

A tape measure is a flexible ruler used to measure size or distance. It consists of a ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber, or metal strip with linear-measurement markings.

## Use / Function

- **Measurement:** Measuring long distances or around curves.
- **Construction:** Layout and framing.
- **Tailoring:** Measuring body dimensions for clothing.
- **Scale:** Personal to Construction.

## Operating principle

It is a common design of a **flexible ruler**.
- **Retractable:** Most modern tape measures use a stiff, curved metal strip that can remain straight when extended but coils up into a compact case using a spring mechanism.
- **Flexible:** Fabric tapes are soft and used for sewing.

## How to create it

1.  **Ribbon Creation:** Create a long, flexible strip of material (fabric, thin metal).
2.  **Marking:** Calibrate and mark units of length along the strip.
3.  **Housing (Optional):** Create a spool or case to wind the tape for storage.
4.  **End Hook:** Attach a metal hook at zero to grab onto edges.

- **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate (for spring mechanism).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Flexible material (cloth, fiberglass, thin steel).
- **Tools:** Marking tools, standard reference.

## Variants and improvements

- **Sewing Tape:** Soft fabric/plastic, no spring.
- **Carpenter's Tape:** Stiff metal curve, spring-loaded return.
- **Surveyor's Tape:** Very long (30m+), open reel.

## Limits and risks

- **Stretching:** Fabric tapes can stretch over time, losing accuracy.
- **Sag:** Long tapes sag in the middle, requiring tension correction.
- **Sharp Edges:** Metal tapes can cut skin if retracted too fast.
