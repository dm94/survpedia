# Brief description

Lens grinding is the precise mechanical process of shaping a transparent material (usually **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz)**) into a curved surface to refract light. It transforms a rough blank into a precision optical component for instruments like **[Telescopes](/en/inventions/telescope)** and **[Microscopes](/en/inventions/microscope)**.

## Use / Function

- **Optical Components:** Creating convex (converging) and concave (diverging) lenses.
- **Precision Surface:** Smoothing flat surfaces for mirrors or prisms.
- **Correction:** Adjusting the focal length of existing lenses.

## Operating principle

The process relies on **controlled abrasion**. Hard, sharp particles (abrasives) are rubbed between the lens blank and a tool (lap).

1.  **Grinding:** Coarse abrasives remove material quickly to shape the curve.
2.  **Smoothing:** Finer abrasives remove the deep pits left by the coarse ones.
3.  **Polishing:** Extremely fine particles in a soft matrix (pitch) shave off the microscopic peaks, leaving a transparent surface.

## How to create it

The method described is for a standard spherical lens.

1.  **Preparation:** Cut a **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz)** disk (the blank). Prepare a "tool" of the same size (another glass disk or an iron disk).
2.  **Rough Grinding (Hogging):**
    - Place coarse **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** (or emery) and water between the blank and the tool.
    - Rub them together. To make a concave curve (hollow), place the blank on top and stroke center-over-center. To make convex, place the blank on the bottom.
    - The abrasive breaks down and cuts the glass. Replenish often.
3.  **Fine Grinding:**
    - Once the curve depth (sagitta) is reached, switch to finer sand.
    - Wash everything thoroughly to remove _every_ coarse grain. A single coarse grain will scratch the glass and ruin the work.
    - Repeat with successively finer grades until the surface is smooth and frosted/opaque.
4.  **Polishing:**
    - Cover the tool with hot **[Pitch](/en/materials/pitch)** (or beeswax/rosin mix) and press the lens onto it to shape the pitch.
    - Use a slurry of water and **Rouge** (Iron Oxide/Rust) or Tripoli.
    - Rub the lens on the pitch lap for hours. The pitch holds the fine particles, which plane the glass surface until it becomes transparent.

**Technical Level:** Advanced. Requires extreme cleanliness and patience.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Blank:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz)**.
  - **Tool:** Another piece of glass, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, or **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)**.
  - **Abrasives:** **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** (sifted to different sizes), Emery (Corundum), Crushed Garnet.
  - **Polishing Agent:** **[Rouge](/en/materials/iron-oxide)** (Iron Oxide/Rust), Tripoli (rottenstone), or wood ash (less effective).
  - **Lap Base:** **[Pitch](/en/materials/pitch)**, Beeswax, or Felt/Leather (for lower quality).
  - **Lubricant:** **[Water](/en/materials/water)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Lathe Grinding:** Mounting the tool on a spinning **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)** allows for faster, more even grinding.
- **Fixed Post:** Walking around a barrel (post) while grinding helps randomize the stroke and keep the curve spherical.
- **Templates:** Metal gauges cut to the specific radius to check progress.

## Limits and risks

- **Scratches:** Inadequate cleaning between grit stages causes deep scratches that require restarting from the coarse stage.
- **Astigmatism:** Irregular pressure or strokes create a non-spherical (football-shaped) curve, distorting the image.
- **Silicosis:** Grinding creates fine glass/silica dust. **Always grind wet** to prevent inhaling the dust.
- **Thermal Shock:** Friction generates heat; the glass can crack if it gets too hot or cools too fast.
