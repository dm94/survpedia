# Brief description

A thermometer is an instrument used to measure temperature or temperature gradient. It is essential for monitoring weather, cooking, medical diagnosis, and scientific experiments.

## Use / Function

- **Meteorology:** Measuring air and soil temperature to predict weather patterns.
- **Medicine:** Monitoring body temperature to detect fever and illness.
- **Cooking:** Ensuring food is cooked to safe temperatures.
- **Industry:** Monitoring processes that require specific thermal conditions.
- **Scale:** Personal to Industrial.

## Operating principle

Most traditional thermometers rely on the principle of **thermal expansion**.

1.  **Expansion:** A liquid (like mercury or alcohol) or a solid (bimetallic strip) expands when heated and contracts when cooled.
2.  **Constraint:** The material is constrained in a narrow tube or fixed configuration, so the expansion translates into visible movement along a scale.
3.  **Readout:** The level of the liquid or the position of the needle corresponds to a specific temperature value based on calibration.

## How to create it

Creating a basic liquid-in-glass thermometer:

1.  **Tube Preparation:** A glass tube with a very fine bore (capillary) is required. A bulb is blown at one end.
2.  **Filling:** The bulb and part of the tube are filled with a liquid (alcohol dyed red is common and safer than mercury).
3.  **Sealing:** The liquid is heated to expand it to the top of the tube to expel air, and then the top is sealed shut.
4.  **Calibration:**
    - Place in melting ice: Mark this point as 0°C (32°F).
    - Place in boiling water (at sea level): Mark this point as 100°C (212°F).
    - Divide the distance between these points into equal degrees.

- **Technical level:** Intermediate (requires glassblowing skills).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:**
  - **Glass tubing:** Uniform bore is critical for accuracy.
  - **Expansion liquid:** Alcohol (ethanol) or Mercury (toxic, use with caution).
- **Tools:** Heat source (torch) for glassworking, scale marking tools.
- **Substitutes:**
  - **Bimetallic strip:** Two different metals bonded together that curl when heated (used in dial thermometers).
  - **Galileo thermometer:** Uses glass spheres of different densities in a liquid.

## Variants and improvements

- **Liquid-in-glass:** The classic design.
- **Bimetallic:** Robust, used in ovens and outdoor dials.
- **Thermocouple:** Modern, uses electrical voltage generated by dissimilar metals (Seebeck effect).
- **Infrared:** Measures thermal radiation from a distance (non-contact).

## Limits and risks

- **Range:** Alcohol boils at ~78°C, so it cannot measure high temperatures (use mercury or bimetallic for that). Mercury freezes at -39°C.
- **Fragility:** Glass thermometers break easily.
- **Toxicity:** Mercury is highly toxic if the thermometer breaks.
- **Calibration:** Needs to be checked periodically; air pressure affects boiling point calibration.
