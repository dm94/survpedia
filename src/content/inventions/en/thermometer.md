# Brief description

A thermometer is an instrument used to measure temperature or temperature gradient. It has two important elements: a temperature sensor (e.g., the bulb of a mercury-in-glass thermometer) in which some physical change occurs with temperature, and some means of converting this physical change into a numerical value (e.g., the visible scale).

## Use / Function

- **Meteorology:** Measuring air temperature to predict weather.
- **Medicine:** Measuring body temperature to detect fever.
- **Cooking:** Ensuring food cooks to a safe temperature.
- **Science/Industrial:** Monitoring chemical reactions and processes.

## Operating principle

Most traditional thermometers rely on **thermal expansion**. As a substance heats up, it expands. By confining a liquid (like alcohol or mercury) in a very narrow tube, a small expansion in volume results in a large visible increase in column height.

## How to create it

### Liquid-in-glass Thermometer
1.  **Materials:** A narrow glass tube with a bulb at one end (capillary tube), alcohol (dyed red for visibility) or mercury.
2.  **Assembly:** Fill the bulb with liquid. Heat the liquid to expel air, then seal the top of the tube while hot. Upon cooling, a vacuum forms.
3.  **Calibration:**
    - Place in melting ice: Mark this point as 0°C (32°F).
    - Place in boiling water (at sea level): Mark this point as 100°C (212°F).
    - Divide the distance into 100 equal parts (Celsius degrees).

- **Technical level:** Advanced (requires glassblowing skills).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Glass tube, expansive liquid (alcohol is safer than mercury).
- **Tools:** Heat source (torch) to seal glass.
- **Substitutes:** Bimetallic strip (two bonded metals that bend when heated) can be used for dial thermometers.

## Variants and improvements

- **Galileo Thermometer:** Uses glass spheres of different densities in a liquid.
- **Bimetallic Thermometer:** Uses a coil of two different metals.
- **Digital Thermometer:** Uses a thermistor or thermocouple.
- **Infrared Thermometer:** Measures thermal radiation from a distance.

## Limits and risks

- **Range:** Alcohol boils at ~78°C, so it cannot measure boiling water. Mercury freezes at -39°C.
- **Fragility:** Glass breaks easily.
- **Toxicity:** Mercury is highly toxic if the thermometer breaks.
