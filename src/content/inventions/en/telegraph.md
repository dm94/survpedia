# Brief description

The telegraph is a communication system that transmits electric signals over wires from location to location. It translates mechanical action (tapping a key) into electrical pulses that produce a sound or mark at the receiving end.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Long-distance instantaneous communication.
- **Secondary uses**: Coordination of transport (trains), military command, time synchronization.
- **Scale**: From local (room to room) to continental.

## Operating principle

**Electromagnetism**:

1.  **The Circuit**: A battery is connected to a loop of wire that stretches between two stations.
2.  **The Transmitter (Key)**: A switch that normally breaks the circuit. When pressed, it completes the circuit, allowing electricity to flow.
3.  **The Receiver (Sounder)**: An electromagnet (a coil of wire wrapped around a piece of iron). When electricity flows through the coil, it becomes magnetic and attracts a movable iron arm (armature).
4.  **The Signal**: The armature hits a stop, making a "click" sound. When the key is released, a spring pulls the armature back, making a "clack".
5.  **The Code**: Patterns of short and long clicks (dots and dashes) represent letters and numbers (e.g., Morse Code).

## How to create it

### 1. The Electromagnet (Receiver)

- Wrap insulated copper wire around a soft iron core (like a large iron nail or bolt).
- Leave two ends of the wire exposed to connect to the circuit.
- Mount it on a wooden base.

### 2. The Sounder

- Mount a strip of flexible metal (iron or steel) or a hinged metal arm above the electromagnet.
- The metal must be close enough to be pulled down when the magnet is on, but spring back up when it's off.
- Add a "stop" (a screw or nail) for the metal to hit to make a sharp sound.

### 3. The Key (Transmitter)

- Create a simple springy switch using a strip of metal screwed to a wooden block.
- When pushed down, it should touch a contact point (another screw) to close the circuit.

### 4. Connection

- Connect the Battery, Key, and Electromagnet in a single series circuit.
- For long distances, run two wires between stations, or use one wire and the Earth (ground) as the return path.

## Materials needed

- **Insulated Copper Wire**: For the coils and transmission lines.
- **Soft Iron**: For the electromagnet core (nails, bolts). Soft iron loses magnetism quickly when power is cut (essential for fast signaling).
- **Ferrous Metal Strip**: For the armature (can be from a tin can or scrap iron).
- **Wood**: For the base and structure.
- **Power Source**: A battery (Voltaic pile or Daniell cell).

## Variants and improvements

- **Earth Return**: Using the ground instead of a second wire saves 50% of the copper.
- **Relay**: For very long distances, the signal gets weak. A relay is a sensitive telegraph receiver that acts as a switch for a fresh local battery circuit, repeating the signal with full power to the next station.
- **Sounder vs. Writer**: Early versions marked paper tape; later operators preferred listening to the clicks ("Sounder").

## Limits and risks

- **Resistance**: Thin wires over long distances have high resistance, weakening the current. You need thicker wires, higher voltage, or relays.
- **Privacy**: Anyone tapping into the wire can read the message.
- **Skill**: Requires learning a code (like Morse) to use effectively.
- **Weather**: Lightning strikes on the line can destroy equipment and kill operators. Lightning arresters (spark gaps) are essential.
