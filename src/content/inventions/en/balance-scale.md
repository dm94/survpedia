# Brief description

A device for measuring mass by comparing an object of unknown mass with an object of known mass.

## Use / Function

- **Trade**: Weighing gold, spices, food.
- **Chemistry/Medicine**: Measuring ingredients.

## Operating principle

Leverage. A beam pivots at its center (fulcrum). Gravity acts on masses at both ends. When the beam is horizontal, the torque on both sides is equal. If arms are equal length, masses are equal.

## How to create it

1.  **Beam**: A straight, rigid stick or bone.
2.  **Fulcrum**: Find the exact center of mass of the beam. Drill a hole or tie a string there.
3.  **Pans**: Hang two identical lightweight containers from the ends of the beam, equidistant from the center.
4.  **Check**: It must balance perfectly when empty. If not, shave weight off the heavier side.

## Materials needed

- Wood/Bone (Beam)
- String/Leather (Suspension)
- Gourd/Basket/Clay (Pans)

## Variants and improvements

- **Steelyard Balance**: Uses a fixed counterweight and a movable fulcrum (or movable weight on long arm) to measure variable masses with one weight.
