# Brief description

A manual lathe is a machine tool that rotates a workpiece about an axis of rotation to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, or drilling. It allows for the creation of precise cylindrical or spherical objects.

## Use / Function

- **Woodturning:** Creating legs for furniture, bowls, tool handles, and decorative items.
- **Metalworking:** Working with soft metals to create precise parts (screws, pins).
- **Pottery:** The potter's wheel is a vertical variation of the lathe.
- **Precision:** Essential for creating other machine parts (screws, pulleys).

## Operating principle

The workpiece is held between two points (headstock and tailstock) or on a faceplate. It is rotated rapidly. A sharp stationary tool (chisel) is pressed against the rotating surface, shaving off material to shape the object. The rotation ensures perfect radial symmetry.

## How to create it

### Spring Pole Lathe (Primitive)

1.  **Frame:** Build a sturdy wooden bed with two uprights.
2.  **Points:** Insert metal spikes (centers) into the uprights to hold the wood. One must be adjustable.
3.  **Power:** Attach a flexible sapling or pole above the lathe. Tie a rope to the tip, wrap it around the workpiece, and tie the other end to a foot treadle.
4.  **Action:** Pressing the treadle spins the wood (cutting stroke); the spring pole pulls it back (return stroke).

### Bow Lathe (Portable)

1.  Similar setup but powered by moving a bow back and forth, wrapping the string around the workpiece.

### Flywheel Lathe (Continuous)

1.  Uses a heavy flywheel and a crank or treadle mechanism to maintain continuous rotation and momentum.

## Materials needed

- **Frame:** Sturdy wood (oak, beech).
- **Centers:** Hardened iron or steel spikes (essential for reducing friction and wear).
- **Drive**: Rope ([leather](/en/materials/leather) or fiber).
- **Spring:** Flexible wood pole or bungee.
- **Cutting Tools:** Chisels made of hardened steel or iron.

## Variants and improvements

- **Potter's Wheel:** Vertical axis for clay.
- **Treadle Lathe:** Uses a flywheel for continuous rotation.
- **Screw-cutting Lathe:** Advanced version with gears to cut precise threads.

## Limits and risks

- **Reciprocating Motion:** Pole/bow lathes only cut on the downstroke (50% efficiency).
- **Speed Limits:** Manual power limits the cutting speed, making it hard to turn very hard materials.
- **Safety:** Loose clothing or hair can be caught in the rotating machinery.
- **Vibration:** A flimsy frame will cause chatter, ruining the finish.
