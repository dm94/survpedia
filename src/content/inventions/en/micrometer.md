# Brief description

High-precision measuring instrument used to measure very small dimensions with accuracies of hundredths or thousandths of a millimeter.

## Use / Function

- **Precision Mechanics:** Measuring shafts, sheet thicknesses, wires, and machined parts.
- **Engineering:** Quality control in manufacturing.

## Operating principle

Based on the **micrometer screw**: a screw with a very fine and precise thread.
Turning the screw advances it a very small, known distance (pitch). Rotation is amplified on a circular scale, allowing fractions of a turn to be read.

## How to create it

1. **C-Frame:** A rigid frame that does not deform.
2. **Anvil and Spindle:** Flat, parallel contact surfaces.
3. **Screw:** A fine-pitch screw (e.g., 0.5 mm per turn).
4. **Thimble:** Graduated cylinder attached to the screw.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Hardened steel (to avoid wear on tips and thread), Cast iron (for the frame).
- **Tools:** High-precision lathe, grinding tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Outside Micrometer:** For measuring external thicknesses and diameters.
- **Inside Micrometer:** For measuring hole diameters.
- **Depth Micrometer:** For measuring groove depth.

## Limits and risks

- **Clamping Force:** Overtightening can deform the part or instrument (a ratchet is used to limit force).
- **Temperature:** Hand heat can expand the frame; should be held by thermal insulation.
- **Cleanliness:** Dust on the screw or faces ruins measurement.
