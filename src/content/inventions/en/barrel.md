# Brief description

A hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, typically made of wooden staves bound by metal hoops. Barrels are iconic for storing and aging liquids like wine and whiskey, but also for transporting dry goods.

## Use / Function

- **Storage:** Aging alcoholic beverages (wine, whiskey), storing water, salted meat, or gunpowder.
- **Transport:** The bulging shape allows a heavy barrel to be rolled and pivoted easily by a single person.
- **Fermentation:** A vessel for brewing beer or fermenting wine.
- **Scale:** Individual (small keg) to industrial (large tun).

## Operating principle

- **Geometry:** The "bilge" (bulge) makes the barrel stronger under pressure and easier to roll/turn.
- **Compression:** The metal hoops compress the wooden staves together. When the wood swells with moisture, the joints become watertight without glue.
- **Aging:** Wood (especially oak) allows slow oxygenation and imparts flavors (vanilla, tannins) to the liquid.

## How to create it

1.  **Stave Preparation:** Cut and shape wooden planks (staves) to be wider in the middle and tapered at ends. Ideally from **[Oak](/en/materials/wood)**.
2.  **Assembly (Raising):** Arrange staves inside a temporary metal hoop.
3.  **Bending:** Heat the staves (with fire or steam) to make them pliable, then winch them together at the open end.
4.  **Hooping:** Drive permanent **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** hoops down the barrel to lock staves in place.
5.  **Toasting (Optional):** Char the inside for flavor (for spirits).
6.  **Heading:** Insert the flat circular lids (heads) into grooves (crozes) cut into the stave ends.

## Materials needed

- **Staves:** High-quality **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** (White Oak is best for liquids; Pine for dry goods).
- **Hoops:** **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** strips, or flexible wood (hazel/willow) in primitive versions.
- **Tools:** Hammer, driver, croze (groove cutter), winch.

## Variants and improvements

- **Keg:** Small barrel (often metal) for beer.
- **Cask:** General term for wooden containers of various sizes.
- **Plastic Drum:** Modern industrial standard (HDPE), chemically resistant but no aging benefits.
- **Rain Barrel:** Adapted for collecting water from gutters.

## Limits and risks

- **Leakage:** If the wood dries out, the staves shrink and the barrel leaks. Must be kept moist ("swelled").
- **Evaporation:** "Angel's share" - some liquid evaporates through the wood pores over time.
- **Sanitation:** Wood is hard to sanitize; bacteria can spoil the contents (e.g., vinegar taint).
- **Weight:** Extremely heavy when full; dangerous if rolling out of control.
