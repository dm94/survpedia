# Brief description

A foundation is the lowest part of a structure, designed to transfer the load of the building to the ground. It provides stability and prevents the structure from sinking or collapsing.

## Use / Function

- **Load Transfer:** Distributes the weight of the building over a large enough area of soil to prevent excessive settlement.
- **Stability:** Anchors the building against wind, earthquakes, and other lateral forces.
- **Level Surface:** Provides a level base for construction on uneven ground.
- **Moisture Barrier:** Can help prevent ground moisture from entering the structure.

## Operating principle

- **Distribution:** By widening the base of a wall or column (footing), the pressure (Force/Area) on the soil is reduced to a level the soil can support.
- **Friction/Bearing:** Deep foundations (piles) rely on friction against the soil or bearing on hard rock deep underground.

## How to create it

1.  **Site Assessment:** Determine soil type and load-bearing capacity. Avoid soft clay or peat.
2.  **Excavation:** Dig trenches or pits to solid ground (below the frost line in cold climates to prevent heaving).
3.  **Bedding:** Place a layer of compacted gravel or sand to ensure drainage and a level base.
4.  **Forming:** Set up molds (if using concrete) or guide lines (for masonry).
5.  **Construction:**
    - **Stone/Brick:** Lay heavy, flat stones or fired bricks with **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** or **[Cement](/en/materials/cement)**.
    - **Concrete:** Pour **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)** into the trench/forms.
6.  **Curing/Setting:** Allow the material to harden fully before building walls on top.

## Materials needed

- **[Stone](/en/materials/stone):** Traditional, durable, heavy.
- **[Brick](/en/materials/brick):** Fired bricks are suitable; **[Adobe](/en/materials/adobe)** is generally not recommended for foundations due to water sensitivity.
- **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete):** The modern standard, often reinforced with **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
- **[Cement](/en/materials/cement):** Essential binder for modern foundations.
- **[Mortar](/en/materials/mortar):** To bond masonry units.
- **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Can be used as piles in wet ground (if kept submerged) or temporary forms.

## Variants and improvements

- **Strip Foundation:** A continuous strip of masonry or concrete under load-bearing walls.
- **Pad Foundation:** Isolated pads under columns.
- **Raft Foundation:** A single slab covering the entire footprint (good for soft ground).
- **Rubble Trench:** A trench filled with packed stones (provides drainage but less load capacity).
- **Pile Foundation:** Long poles driven deep into the ground (for very soft soil or large structures).

## Limits and risks

- **Settlement:** If the ground compresses unevenly, the building will crack.
- **Frost Heave:** In freezing climates, water in the soil expands and lifts the foundation if it's not deep enough.
- **Water:** Groundwater can weaken the soil or the foundation material (especially mortar).
- **Scour:** Running water can wash away soil from under the foundation.
