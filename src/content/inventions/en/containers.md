# Brief description

Containers are hollow objects designed to transport, organize, or preserve solid or liquid materials.

## Use / Function

- **Storage:** Storing surplus food, seeds, or water.
- **Transport:** Facilitating the movement of collected objects.
- **Cooking:** Allowing the boiling of food (if heat-resistant).
- **Scale:** Domestic and collective.

## Operating principle

They create a physical barrier that groups dispersed elements and, in the case of liquids, use waterproof or sealed materials to prevent leaks.

## How to create it

- **Basketry:** Interweaving flexible plant fibers (plant-fibers) to create a rigid or semi-rigid structure.
- **Sacks:** Sewing pieces of leather or fabric together.
- **Vessels:** Shaping clay and firing it to achieve impermeability and thermal resistance.
- **Technical level:** Basic to Intermediate.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Wicker, esparto, reeds, animal skins, clay.
- **Tools:** Awls, needles, hands.
- **Substitutes:** Animal stomachs (for water), hollowed-out gourds, carved wood.

## Variants and improvements

- **Watertight basket:** Coated with resin or bitumen to carry water.
- **Amphorae:** Designed for massive maritime transport.
- **Modular containers:** To optimize space.

## Limits and risks

- **Weight:** The container adds dead weight to transport.
- **Moisture:** Baskets can rot; unglazed ceramics can leak.
- **Breakage:** Ceramics are fragile; sacks can tear.
