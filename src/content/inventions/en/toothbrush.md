# Brief description

The toothbrush is a handheld tool designed to clean teeth and gums. It consists of a handle with bristles at one end, used to remove food debris and bacterial plaque through friction.

## Use / Function

Its main function is mechanical oral hygiene:

- **Plaque removal**: Disrupts bacterial colonies that cause cavities and gum disease.
- **Debris cleaning**: Removes food particles from between teeth.
- **Stimulation**: Massages gums to improve circulation.
- **Scale**: Personal and non-transferable.

## Operating principle

It works through gentle abrasion and mechanical sweeping. Flexible bristles penetrate interdental spaces and molar grooves, sweeping away dirt. When used with a cleaning agent (paste or powder), effectiveness increases due to additional chemical or abrasive action.

## How to create it

1.  **Handle**: Carve a piece of wood or bone so it is comfortable to hold.
2.  **Head**: Make small holes at one end of the handle or prepare a slot.
3.  **Bristles**:
    - **Animal hair**: Use stiff bristles from pig or boar (boiled to disinfect).
    - **Plant fibers**: Use tough fibers from roots or crushed stems.
4.  **Fixing**: Insert bristles into holes and secure with thread or natural glue (resin), or tie firmly if using the "chewing stick" method.

### Simplified version (Chewing Stick)

Take a twig from a suitable tree (like neem, olive, or licorice), peel the tip, and chew it until the fibers separate forming a natural brush.

## Materials needed

- **Handle**: Hardwood or bone.
- **Bristles**: Stiff animal hair (boar) or resistant plant fibers.
- **Adhesive**: Pine resin (optional, for fixing).

## Variants and improvements

- **Chewing stick (Miswak)**: The oldest and simplest form, often with natural antiseptic properties from the plant itself.
- **Bristle brush**: More modern design with bristles inserted perpendicularly.
- **Floss**: Essential complement, can be made with silk fibers or fine, strong threads.

## Limits and risks

- **Wear**: Natural bristles wear out and can harbor bacteria. They must be dried well.
- **Gum damage**: Brushing too aggressively or with very hard bristles can recede gums and wear down enamel.
- **Contamination**: If not cleaned and dried, the brush can become a breeding ground for bacteria.
