# Brief description

A machine for converting the energy of flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. It was a primary source of industrial power before the steam engine.

## Use / Function

- **Milling:** Grinding grain into flour (gristmill).
- **Industrial:** Powering bellows for smelting, tripping hammers for forging, or sawing wood.
- **Pumping:** Lifting water for irrigation.

## Operating principle

The water wheel uses the kinetic energy (flow) or potential energy (height) of water.

- **Undershot:** Water flows under the wheel, pushing paddles. Efficient in fast-flowing rivers.
- **Overshot:** Water is channeled to the top of the wheel, filling buckets. The weight of the water turns the wheel. More efficient.
- **Breastshot:** Water strikes the wheel at mid-height.

## How to create it

1.  **Axle:** Create a massive, strong [axle](/en/inventions/axle) (tree trunk) capable of transmitting high torque.
2.  **Wheel Structure:** Build two large parallel [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel) attached to the axle.
3.  **Paddles/Buckets:** Connect the two wheels with paddles (for undershot) or buckets (for overshot).
4.  **Mounting:** Mount the axle on sturdy bearings (stone or greased wood) over the water source.
5.  **Gearing:** Connect the axle to a gear system to transfer the slow, high-torque rotation to the machinery (e.g., millstones).

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Water-resistant [wood](/en/materials/wood) (oak, larch) for the wheel and buckets.
- **Stone:** For the bearings and foundations.
- **Iron:** For reinforcing the axle and gears.

## Variants and improvements

- **Noria:** A water wheel used specifically for lifting water into an aqueduct.
- **Turbine:** A more advanced, enclosed water wheel (Pelton, Francis) for higher efficiency.

## Limits and risks

- **Location:** Strictly dependent on a reliable water source with flow or head.
- **Freezing:** Can freeze in winter, stopping production.
- **Flooding:** High water levels can submerge or destroy the wheel.
