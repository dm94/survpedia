# Brief description

A fly catcher is a simple trap that reduces flies by attracting them with bait and capturing them using a sticky surface or a one-way entrance.

## Use / Function

- **Pest control:** Reduce flies around food, animals, and waste.
- **Food safety:** Lower contamination risk in kitchens and storage.
- **Hygiene:** Improve comfort and reduce disease transmission.
- **Scale:** Household, pantry, animal sheds.

## Operating principle

Flies follow strong odors from sweet or fermenting bait. Once they land on a sticky surface or enter a narrow funnel, they cannot escape. Stickiness comes from **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)** or **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**. Bait is made with **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, and **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** or fruit scraps.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare bait:** Warm **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and dissolve **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**, add a small amount of **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** or fruit mash.
2. **Make a sticky strip:** Brush **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)** or warmed **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** onto a strip of **[Paper](/en/materials/paper)**.
3. **Build a bottle trap:** Place bait in a **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** jar and insert a cone of **[Paper](/en/materials/paper)** with a small opening.
4. **Hang or place:** Use **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** to suspend strips or set jars near fly paths.
5. **Maintain:** Replace bait and sticky strips as they dry or fill.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Paper](/en/materials/paper)**, **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)** or **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**, **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**.
- **Containers/structure:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** jar, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frame, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for hanging.
- **Tools:** Knife, pot, brush.
- **Substitutes:** Honey or fruit mash for bait, clay pot instead of glass, cloth strips instead of paper.

## Variants and improvements

- **Flypaper ribbons:** Long strips hung near windows and doors.
- **Funnel jar:** Narrow cone improves one-way entry.
- **Covered bait cup:** Small lid holes reduce dust and splashes.
- **Outdoor shelter:** Simple **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** roof to protect from rain.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target insects:** May capture beneficial insects.
- **Mess:** Sticky surfaces attract dust and debris.
- **Odor:** Fermenting bait can smell if left too long.
- **Weather:** Wind and rain reduce effectiveness outdoors.
