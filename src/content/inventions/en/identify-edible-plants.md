# Brief description

A practical guide to recognize edible plants and avoid toxic species through observation, comparison, and controlled tasting steps.

## Use / Function

- **Survival:** Obtain safe plant food when no supply exists.
- **Foraging:** Select leaves, roots, fruits, and seeds that are safe to eat.
- **Food safety:** Reduce poisoning from misidentification.
- **Scale:** Personal and community.

## Operating principle

It relies on **basic botanical identification** (shape, leaves, flowers, habitat) and **risk filters** that exclude plants with warning signs. When certainty is low, a **gradual edibility test** is used by parts to limit exposure.

## How to create it

1. **Observe the environment:** Note habitat, season, and growth pattern (tree, shrub, herb, vine).
2. **Describe morphology:** Leaf shape, edge, arrangement (opposite/alternate), venation, sap color, and smell when crushed.
3. **Filter warning signs:** Avoid plants with **milky latex**, bitter almond or chemical smell, overly glossy fruits, extremely bitter seeds, or unidentified families.
4. **Prioritize safer options:** Known edible herbs, starchy roots, and fruits identified with certainty.
5. **Separate by parts:** Leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, and roots must be assessed independently.
6. **Gradual testing:** Cook when possible and test small amounts, waiting long enough before increasing intake.
7. **Record results:** Keep simple notes to repeat safe choices and avoid doubtful ones.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Clean container, **[water](/en/materials/water)** for washing and cooking, heat source if available.
- **Tools:** Knife, basket or carrier using **[plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**, grinding stone if processing.
- **Substitutes:** Large leaves for wrapping, natural containers (gourds or bark).

## Variants and improvements

- **Seasonal calendar:** List of safe species by season.
- **Local comparison:** Use regional guides or ethnobotanical knowledge.
- **Preservation:** Drying or pre-cooking to reduce toxins and improve storage.

## Limits and risks

- **Identification errors:** The main cause of poisoning.
- **Cumulative toxins:** Some plants are safe in small amounts but harmful over time.
- **Allergies:** Unexpected reactions even with edible plants.
- **Contamination:** Pesticides, heavy metals, or wastewater can make them dangerous.
- **Mushrooms:** High-risk and not for consumption without expert identification.
