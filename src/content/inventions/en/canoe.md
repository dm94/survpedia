# Brief description

A canoe is a lightweight narrow vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers using a single-bladed paddle. It is one of the oldest forms of water transport.

## Use / Function

- **Transportation:** Moving people and goods across rivers, lakes, and calm coastal waters.
- **Fishing:** Providing a stable platform for fishing in various water bodies.
- **Exploration:** Allowing travel into shallow or narrow waterways inaccessible to larger ships.

## Operating principle

**Buoyancy:** The canoe displaces a volume of water equal to its own weight plus the weight of its occupants, allowing it to float. Its narrow, pointed shape minimizes water resistance (drag), making it efficient to propel and easy to maneuver.

## How to create it (Dugout version)

1. **Tree Selection:** Choose a large, straight, rot-resistant tree trunk (e.g., cedar, redwood, or pine).
2. **Felling and Sizing:** Fell the tree and cut it to the desired length.
3. **Hollowing:** Use controlled fire to char the interior wood, then scrape away the burnt material with adzes or stone scrapers. Repeat until hollow.
4. **Shaping:** Hew the exterior to a hydrodynamic shape, tapering the ends.
5. **Finishing:** Smooth the hull and seal it with animal fat, oil, or resin to prevent water absorption.

## Materials needed

- **Hull:** A single large log (for dugout) or wooden ribs and bark (for birch bark canoe).
- **Sealant:** Resin, pitch, or animal fats.
- **Tools:** Adzes, axes, scrapers, and fire.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dugout Canoe:** Carved from a single log. Durable but heavy.
- **Bark Canoe:** Made by stretching bark (like birch) over a wooden frame. Very light and portable.
- **Modern Canoes:** Made from aluminum, fiberglass, or Kevlar for extreme durability and lightness.

## Limits and risks

- **Stability:** Narrow hulls can be tippy; improper weight distribution can cause capsizing.
- **Capacity:** Limited by the size of the vessel and buoyancy.
- **Water Conditions:** Not suitable for heavy seas or very rough rapids without advanced skill and design.
