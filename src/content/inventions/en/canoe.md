A canoe is a lightweight narrow vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers.

## Fabrication

1. **Tree Selection**: A large, straight tree trunk is selected, often from species like cedar or pine.
2. **Hollowing**: The interior of the log is hollowed out. Traditionally, this was done using controlled fire to char the wood, followed by scraping with stone tools.
3. **Shaping**: The exterior is shaped to improve aerodynamics and stability in water.
4. **Finishing**: The surface is smoothed and sometimes treated with oils or resins for better water resistance.
