# Brief description

A **Rolling Mill** is a machine used to reduce the thickness of metal and make it uniform. It passes the metal stock through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness and make the thickness uniform. The process is similar to rolling out dough.

## Use / Function

- **Thickness Reduction:** Reducing the cross-sectional area of a metal piece (ingot, billet, slab).
- **Shape Forming:** Creating structural shapes like [Rails](/en/inventions/rail), I-beams, channels, and angles.
- **Surface Finish:** Improving the surface finish of the metal.
- **Material Properties:** Cold rolling can increase the strength of the metal via strain hardening.

## Operating principle

The rolling mill operates on the principle of **plastic deformation**. The metal is passed between two rolls that are rotating in opposite directions. The gap between the rolls is smaller than the thickness of the metal entering them. As the metal passes through, it is compressed, reducing its thickness and increasing its length. Friction between the rolls and the metal pulls the metal through.

## How to create it

1.  **Frame Construction:** Build a heavy, rigid **[Frame](/en/inventions/frame)** (usually cast iron or steel) to withstand the immense separating forces generated during rolling.
2.  **Roll Preparation:** Create two cylinders (rolls) from a hard material like **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**. They must be smooth and harder than the material being rolled.
3.  **Mounting:** Mount the rolls in the frame using heavy-duty **[Bearings](/en/inventions/bearings)** (bronze or brass) to allow them to rotate freely under load.
4.  **Drive Mechanism:** Connect the rolls to a power source (water wheel, steam engine) using **[Gears](/en/inventions/gears)**. The rolls must rotate at the same speed but in opposite directions.
5.  **Adjustment Mechanism:** Install large screws on top of the frame to adjust the gap between the rolls (screw-down mechanism).

## Materials needed

- **Rolls:** Chilled Cast Iron or Alloy Steel for hardness and wear resistance.
- **Frame:** Cast Iron or heavy Steel to resist deformation.
- **Bearings:** Bronze, Brass, or Babbitt metal.
- **Lubricant:** **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** or heavy **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** for the bearings and neck of the rolls. A **[Gear Pump](/en/inventions/gear-pump)** can ensure a constant supply.

## Variants and improvements

- **Two-High Mill:** The simplest form with two rolls.
- **Three-High Mill:** Three rolls arranged vertically. The metal passes forward between the bottom and middle rolls, and backward between the middle and top rolls.
- **Four-High Mill:** Two small work rolls backed up by two larger backup rolls to prevent bending of the work rolls.
- **Slitting Mill:** Uses disk-shaped cutters to slit sheet metal into narrow strips (essential for making nails or coins).

## Limits and risks

- **Roll Deflection:** Under high pressure, rolls can bend, resulting in a product that is thicker in the middle (crowned).
- **Heat:** Hot rolling requires handling red-hot metal, posing severe burn risks.
- **Crushing Hazard:** The nip point between the rolls is extremely dangerous and can pull in tools, clothing, or limbs.
- **Power Requirement:** Requires significant torque and power, often needing a **[Flywheel](/en/inventions/flywheel)** to smooth out the load.
