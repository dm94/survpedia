# Brief description

A steam bath is a heated enclosure that fills with moist heat to clean the body, relax muscles, and support recovery. It can be as simple as a tent over hot stones or as complex as a masonry room with a dedicated heat source.

## Use / Function

- **Hygiene:** Deep cleaning with heat and sweat.
- **Recovery:** Relieves muscle soreness and joint stiffness.
- **Respiratory relief:** Humid heat can ease congestion.
- **Ritual / social:** Communal bathing and health practices.
- **Scale:** Individual to community.

## Operating principle

1. **Heat storage:** Stones or masonry absorb heat from a fire.
2. **Steam generation:** Water is poured on the hot mass, rapidly evaporating.
3. **Humidity + heat:** High humidity reduces evaporative cooling on skin, making the heat feel stronger at lower air temperatures.
4. **Ventilation control:** Limited airflow keeps steam inside while allowing safe air exchange.

## How to create it

- **Minimum functional version:** Heat stones in a fire, place them in a pit or stone circle, cover with a tent or blankets, and add water for steam.
- **Enclosure:** Build a small room of **[stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[brick](/en/materials/brick)** with sealed gaps to retain steam.
- **Heat source:** External firebox or internal stone hearth. Route smoke out or heat stones outside.
- **Drainage:** Slight slope or a small drain to avoid pooling water.
- **Technical level:** Basic (steam tent) to Intermediate (masonry bath).

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, heat-resistant **[stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[wood](/en/materials/wood)** for fuel.
- **Structure:** **[Brick](/en/materials/brick)** and **[mortar](/en/materials/mortar)** for a permanent room.
- **Tools:** Shovel, hammer/maul for moving stones, containers for water.
- **Substitutes:** Earth walls, packed clay, or a bark/cloth tent for enclosure.

## Variants and improvements

- **Sweat lodge:** Low dome with a fire pit outside and stones brought in.
- **Sauna style:** Dry heat with optional water splashes.
- **Hammam style:** Multiple rooms with gradually increasing heat.
- **Herbal steam:** Add **[healing herbs](/en/materials/healing-herbs)** for aroma and respiratory comfort.
- **Chimney draft:** Add a **[chimney](/en/inventions/chimney)** for cleaner air and better heat control.

## Limits and risks

- **Heat stress:** Risk of dehydration, dizziness, or fainting.
- **Burns:** Hot stones and steam can scald skin.
- **Smoke exposure:** Poorly separated fire and steam areas can cause smoke inhalation.
- **Hygiene:** Wet spaces can grow mold if not dried and ventilated.
- **Structural damage:** Rapid heating and cooling can crack stone or masonry.
