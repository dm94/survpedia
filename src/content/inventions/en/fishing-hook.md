# Brief description

A fishing hook is a curved point designed to catch fish by piercing the mouth and holding under tension.

## Use / Function

- **Capture**: Secures fish to a line after a strike.
- **Selectivity**: Hook size helps target species and reduce bycatch.
- **Versatility**: Works from shore, boats, or under ice.

## Operating principle

The point penetrates soft tissue, and the curved shank rotates under pull to set the hook. A barb or inward angle resists escape while tension is maintained.

## How to create it

1. **Shape the blank**: Carve **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)** or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, or forge **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** into a curved form.
2. **Cut the point**: File a sharp tip and add a small barb or inward notch.
3. **Form the eye**: Drill or carve a hole for line attachment.
4. **Seal and smooth**: Use **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** to seal wood or bone and reduce water absorption.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Bone, wood, or iron for the hook body.
- **Tools**: Knife, **[File](/en/inventions/file)**, awl, small hammer.
- **Substitutes**: Thorns or sharpened splinters for emergency hooks.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gorge hook**: Straight toggle that turns sideways in the fish.
- **Barbless hook**: Easier release and less damage to fish.
- **Double hook**: Two points for larger bait.

## Limits and risks

- **Breakage**: Thin points can snap on large fish.
- **Injury**: Hooks can puncture hands during baiting.
- **Corrosion**: Metal hooks rust without drying and oiling.
