# Brief description

A modern bridge design consisting of one or more towers (or pylons), from which cables support the bridge deck. It is distinct from a suspension bridge because the cables run directly from the tower to the deck, rather than hanging from a main cable.

## Use / Function

- **Medium to Long Spans**: Ideal for spans longer than cantilever bridges but shorter than suspension bridges (approx. 200m to 1000m).
- **Aesthetics**: Often chosen for their striking, modern appearance.
- **Efficiency**: Requires less material than a suspension bridge for medium spans.

## Operating principle

The cable-stayed bridge works by **tension** and **compression**:

1.  **Cables (Tension)**: The cables pull the deck up, transferring the weight of the traffic and the deck itself to the towers.
2.  **Towers (Compression)**: The towers support the vertical load from the cables and transfer it to the foundation.
3.  **Deck (Compression)**: The horizontal component of the cable force compresses the deck towards the towers.

Unlike an **[Arch](/en/inventions/arch)** which relies entirely on compression to span a gap, the cable-stayed bridge relies on the high tensile strength of steel cables.

## How to create it

1.  **[Foundations](/en/inventions/foundation)**: Build strong foundations for the towers (pylons) and the anchorages at the ends of the deck.
2.  **Towers**: Construct the vertical towers (usually reinforced concrete or steel).
3.  **Deck & Cables**: Build the deck outwards from the tower in balanced sections.
    - Install a segment of the deck.
    - Attach the corresponding stay cable to the tower and tension it.
    - Repeat on the other side to keep the tower balanced.
4.  **Closure**: Join the deck sections in the middle.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **[Steel Cable](/en/materials/steel-cable)**: High-strength strands are critical.
  - **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**: For towers and deck.
  - **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**: For reinforcement, towers, or deck structure.
- **Tools**: Heavy cranes, hydraulic jacks (for tensioning cables), formwork.

## Variants and improvements

- **Harp Design**: Cables are parallel to each other.
- **Fan Design**: Cables all connect to the top of the tower (more efficient).
- **Single Tower**: Asymmetric designs for specific aesthetic or structural needs.
- **Extradosed Bridge**: A hybrid between a girder bridge and a cable-stayed bridge, with shorter towers and stiffer deck.

## Limits and risks

- **Wind**: Like suspension bridges, they are susceptible to aerodynamic instability (flutter).
- **Cable Vibration**: Rain and wind can cause cables to vibrate violently; dampers are needed.
- **Complexity**: Requires precise engineering to balance the forces during construction.
- **Corrosion**: The cables are the critical weak point; if they rust, the bridge fails.
