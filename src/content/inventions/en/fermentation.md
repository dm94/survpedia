# Brief description

Fermentation is a controlled biological process that uses microbes to transform sugars into acids, alcohols, and gases.

It enables preservation, flavor development, and the production of alcohol, **[Bread](/en/inventions/bread)**, and cultured foods.

## Use / Function

- **Food preservation**: Acid and alcohol inhibit spoilage.
- **Alcohol production**: Beverages and **[Biofuel](/en/materials/biofuel)**.
- **Leavening**: CO2 inflates dough.
- **Nutrient upgrade**: Improves digestibility and adds vitamins.
- **Scale**: Household to community production.

## Operating principle

- Microbes consume sugars in low-oxygen conditions.
- Metabolism produces byproducts: ethanol + CO2 (yeast) or lactic acid (bacteria).
- Salt and temperature control favor desired microbes.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Alcoholic)

1. Mix **[Water](/en/materials/water)** with a sugar source like **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)** or fruit.
2. Add **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or a wild starter.
3. Ferment in a clean **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)** with a loose lid or airlock.
4. Keep at 18–25°C until bubbling stops.

### Minimum functional version (Lactic)

1. Chop vegetables and mix with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** (2–3% by weight).
2. Pack into a clean **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)** and keep submerged in brine.
3. Ferment at room temperature for days to weeks.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)** or other carbohydrate source
  - **[Water](/en/materials/water)**
  - **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or lactic cultures
  - **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** for lactic fermentation
- **Tools**:
  - **Vessels**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots, **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** jars, or **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** barrels
  - Airlock or cloth cover
- **Possible substitutes**:
  - Wild starters from fruit skins
  - Tight-weave cloth instead of an airlock

## Variants and improvements

- **Back-slopping**: Reuse a successful batch to start a new one.
- **Vinegar production**: Expose alcoholic ferment to oxygen.
- **Cold fermentation**: Slower, more controlled flavors.
- **[Distillation](/en/inventions/distillation)**: Concentrate alcohol after fermentation.

## Limits and risks

- **Contamination**: Poor hygiene, wrong salt, or temperature can spoil batches.
- **Pressure buildup**: Sealed containers can burst from CO2.
- **Botulism risk**: Low-acid, low-salt anaerobic conditions are dangerous.
- **Off-flavors**: Excess heat or oxygen can cause spoilage or vinegar.
