# Brief description

Fermentation is a metabolic process where microorganisms (like yeast or bacteria) consume carbohydrates (sugars/starches) in the absence of oxygen to produce energy, creating byproducts like alcohol, acids, or gases.

It allows you to transform raw food materials into longer-lasting, more nutritious, or psychoactive products.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is diverse but centers on transformation and preservation:

- **Preservation**: Lactic acid bacteria produce acid that kills harmful bacteria (sauerkraut, yogurt, salami).
- **Alcohol Production**: Yeasts produce ethanol for beverages (beer, wine) or fuel.
- **Leavening**: CO2 gas production causes dough to rise (bread).
- **Nutrient Enhancement**: Breaking down anti-nutrients and synthesizing vitamins (B12, K).

## Operating principle

The core principle is anaerobic respiration (glycolysis).

1.  **Input**: Simple sugars (Glucose).
2.  **Agent**: Yeast (_Saccharomyces_) or Bacteria (_Lactobacillus_).
3.  **Process**: The agent eats the sugar to survive.
4.  **Output**:
    - **Alcoholic Fermentation**: Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Heat.
    - **Lactic Acid Fermentation**: Glucose → Lactic Acid.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Alcoholic)

1.  **Prepare Substrate**: Mash fruits (source of sugar and water) or mix sugar/honey with water.
2.  **Inoculate**: Add yeast (wild yeast from fruit skins or a starter culture).
3.  **Seal**: Place in a container that allows gas to escape but prevents air (oxygen) from entering (airlock).
4.  **Wait**: Keep at a moderate temperature (20°C) until bubbling stops.

### Minimum functional version (Lactic/Pickling)

1.  **Prepare Substrate**: Chop vegetables (cabbage, cucumbers).
2.  **Salt**: Add salt (2-3% by weight) to draw out water and inhibit bad bacteria.
3.  **Submerge**: Ensure vegetables are under their own brine (liquid).
4.  **Wait**: Keep covered at room temperature for days/weeks.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **Substrate**: Sugar source (fruit, grain, honey, milk, vegetables).
  - **Water**: If not present in the substrate.
  - **Starter**: Yeast or bacterial culture (can be wild/spontaneous).
- **Tools**:
  - **Vessel**: Clay pot, glass jar, wooden barrel (must be clean).
  - **Airlock**: Water seal, loose lid, or cloth to manage gas exchange.

## Variants and improvements

- **Wild Fermentation**: Relying on naturally occurring microbes (unpredictable).
- **Back-slopping**: Using a bit of a previous successful batch to start a new one (sourdough, yogurt).
- **Distillation**: Boiling fermented liquid to concentrate alcohol.
- **Vinegar**: Allowing oxygen access to alcoholic ferment to produce acetic acid.

## Limits and risks

- **Contamination**: "Bad" bacteria or mold can take over if conditions (pH, salt, hygiene) are wrong. Smell is the best indicator; if it smells like rot, discard it.
- **Explosions**: Sealed containers can burst from CO2 pressure.
- **Methanol**: Improper fermentation/distillation of high-pectin woods/fruits can produce toxic methanol (rare in dangerous amounts in simple fermentation, higher risk in distillation).
- **Botulism**: Rare but fatal risk in anaerobic, low-acid, low-salt environments (e.g., fermenting meats/vegetables without enough acid/salt).
