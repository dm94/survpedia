# Brief description

A thin piece of metal or hard material with a sharp point at one end and a head at the other. Used to temporarily hold materials together.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Holding fabric layers in place before sewing.
- **Secondary uses**: Fastening clothing (fibula), attaching papers or notes.

## Operating Principle

Friction. The pin pierces the layers of material, and the friction between the pin shaft and the material prevents it from sliding out easily. The head prevents it from passing completely through.

## How to create it

Similar to a needle, but with a head instead of an eye.

1.  **Wire**: Create a wire of metal or a splinter of bone.
2.  **Point**: Sharpen one end.
3.  **Head**: Flatten, coil, or attach a bead to the other end to stop it from slipping through.

## Materials needed

- **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**: For primitive pins.
- **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)** / **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**: For metal pins.

## Variants and improvements

- **Safety Pin**: A pin bent back on itself to form a spring, with a guard to cover the point.
- **Fibula**: An ancient brooch/pin for fastening garments.

## Limits and risks

- **Pricking**: Sharp point is exposed (unless it's a safety pin).
- **Rust**: Metal pins can rust and stain fabric.
