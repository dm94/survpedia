# Brief description

The oil lamp is a simple device designed to produce light continuously over a period of time, using an oil or fat-based fuel source and a wick. It is one of humanity's oldest forms of artificial lighting.

## Use / Function

Its purpose is to provide controlled artificial lighting.

- **Primary use**: Indoor lighting (homes, temples) and outdoor lighting at night.
- **Secondary uses**: Ceremonial or religious purposes; minor heat source.
- **Scale**: Primarily domestic and local.

## Operating principle

It is based on the principle of **capillarity** and **combustion**:

1.  **Capillarity**: The wick (a porous or fibrous material) absorbs the liquid fuel and transports it upwards against gravity.
2.  **Vaporization**: The heat of the flame vaporizes the fuel at the tip of the wick.
3.  **Combustion**: The fuel vapor mixes with oxygen in the air and burns, producing light and heat, which in turn maintains the cycle by vaporizing more fuel.

The wick acts as a regulator, limiting the amount of fuel reaching the flame to prevent all the oil from burning at once.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version
1.  **Container**: Find or model a small bowl or deep dish made of non-flammable material (clay, stone, seashell, metal).
2.  **Fuel**: Partially fill the container with vegetable oil or melted animal fat.
3.  **Wick**: Place a braided plant fiber or piece of cotton cloth in the oil, leaving one end sticking out over the edge or floating (using a small floating support of cork or light wood).
4.  **Ignition**: Apply fire to the end of the oil-soaked wick.

### Technical level
- **Basic**: Requires only natural materials and simple modeling.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
    - **Non-flammable container**: **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** (pottery), carved **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, shells, metal.
    - **Fuel**: **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)** (olive, sesame, nut) or **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** (tallow, lard).
    - **Wick**: **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** (flax, papyrus, hemp), **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, or strips of old cloth.

## Variants and improvements

- **Shell or Stone Lamp**: The most primitive version (Paleolithic).
- **Terracotta Lamp**: With a spout or nozzle to hold the wick and a handle (Antiquity).
- **Floating Lamp**: The wick floats in the center of the oil using a light support.
- **Argand Lamp (18th century)**: Uses a tubular wick and a glass chimney to improve airflow and brightness (much more efficient).

## Limits and risks

- **Fire Hazard**: If tipped over, burning oil spills and is difficult to extinguish (do not use water).
- **Smoke and Soot**: If the oil is not pure or the wick is too long, it produces black smoke and dirties the environment.
- **Dim Light**: A single lamp produces little light (approximately 1 candela); several are needed to light a room well.
