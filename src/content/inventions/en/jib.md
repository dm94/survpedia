# Brief description

A projecting arm or beam used on cranes and derricks to support the load clear of the main support structure. It extends the reach of the lifting mechanism.

## Use / Function

- **Reach:** Allows lifting loads at a distance from the mast or base.
- **Horizontal Movement:** In rotating cranes, the jib sweeps a circle to move loads horizontally.
- **Radius Adjustment:** By raising or lowering the jib (luffing), the lifting radius can be changed.

## Operating principle

- **Leverage:** The jib acts as a cantilever or supported beam. The load exerts a downward force at the tip, which is countered by the support cable (tension) and the hinge/mast (compression).
- **Triangulation:** The mast, jib, and tie-cable typically form a triangle, distributing the load forces efficiently through the structure.

## How to create it

1.  **Spar Selection:** Select a straight, strong pole (wood) or construct a [truss](/en/inventions/truss) framework (metal). The length determines the reach.
2.  **Hinge Assembly:** Create a pivot point at the base of the jib to attach it to the mast. This allows vertical movement (luffing).
3.  **Sheave Installation:** Mount a [pulley](/en/inventions/pulley) (sheave) at the tip of the jib for the hoist rope to run through.
4.  **Support Cabling:** Attach a strong cable (tie or luffing cable) from the tip of the jib to the top of the mast to support the weight of the jib and the load.

## Materials needed

- **Structural:** Strong [wood](/en/materials/wood) (oak, pine) for simple spars, or [iron](/en/materials/iron)/[steel](/en/materials/steel) trusses for heavy-duty jibs.
- **Fittings:** Metal brackets or heavy rope lashings for the hinge and pulley mount.
- **Cabling:** [Rope](/en/materials/rope) or [steel cable](/en/materials/steel-cable) for the support line.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fixed Jib:** The angle is fixed relative to the mast; only the hook moves up and down. Simpler to build but less flexible.
- **Luffing Jib:** The angle can be changed during operation to move the load closer to or further from the base.
- **Telescopic Jib:** Composed of multiple nested sections that slide inside each other to extend the total length hydraulically or mechanically.
- **Gooseneck Jib:** An angled section at the tip to provide clearance for bulky loads.

## Limits and risks

- **Overloading:** Exceeding the rated capacity can snap the jib or cause the entire crane to tip over.
- **Side-loading:** Pulling loads sideways (instead of vertically) puts twisting forces on the jib that can cause it to buckle and collapse.
- **Fatigue:** Repeated stress cycles can cause microscopic cracks in metal jibs, leading to sudden failure.
- **Clearance:** A long jib requires significant clearance to rotate without hitting obstacles.
