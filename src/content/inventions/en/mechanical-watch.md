# Brief description

A portable timekeeping device driven by a mainspring and regulated by a balance wheel. It allows for personal time management and coordination on the go.

## Use / Function

- **Personal Timekeeping:** Knowing the time of day anywhere.
- **Coordination:** Synchronizing activities between people at different locations.
- **Navigation:** Rough estimation of longitude (less precise than a chronometer).

## Operating principle

Stores energy in a wound spring (mainspring) which is released through a gear train. The speed of release is controlled by an escapement mechanism and a balance wheel that oscillates back and forth at a constant rate.

1. **Energy Source:** Mainspring.
2. **Transmission:** Gear train (wheels and pinions).
3. **Regulation:** Balance wheel and hairspring (isochronism).
4. **Escapement:** Locks and unlocks the gear train, counting oscillations.
5. **Indication:** Hands moving on a dial.

## How to create it

Requires high precision micro-mechanics.

1. **Plates and Bridges:** To hold the moving parts.
2. **Gear Train:** To transmit power and divide time.
3. **Escapement:** Lever or cylinder escapement.
4. **Balance Assembly:** The heart of the watch.
5. **Case:** To protect the movement.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Brass (plates, gears), Steel (pinions, springs, screws), Glass (crystal).
- **Tools:** Lathe, staking tool, tweezers, screwdrivers, loupe.
- **Substitutes:** Early watches used iron; jewels (rubies) are used for bearings to reduce friction.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pocket Watch:** Carried in a pocket.
- **Wristwatch:** Worn on the wrist (requires shock protection).
- **Automatic:** Self-winding via a rotor.
- **Quartz:** Electronic successor.

## Limits and risks

- **Fragility:** Shock, water, and magnetism can stop or damage it.
- **Maintenance:** Needs cleaning and oiling every few years.
- **Accuracy:** Varies by seconds per day (unlike quartz).
