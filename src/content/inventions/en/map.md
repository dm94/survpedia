# Brief description

A symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, and themes. Most commonly, it is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional area (the Earth).

## Use / Function

-   **Navigation**: Finding routes from one place to another.
-   **Planning**: Urban planning, military strategy, resource management.
-   **Record Keeping**: Documenting boundaries, ownership, and terrain features.
-   **Education**: Understanding geography and spatial relationships.

## Operating principle

-   **Projection**: Mathematical transformation of locations on the curved surface of Earth to a flat surface.
-   **Scale**: The ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the ground (e.g., 1:10,000).
-   **Symbology**: Use of standardized icons and colors to represent features (blue for water, green for forests, lines for roads).

## How to create it

### Basic Mapping (Surveying)
1.  **Establish a Baseline**: Measure a straight line distance between two points accurately on the ground using a rope or chain.
2.  **Triangulation**: From each end of the baseline, measure the angle to a third point using a sighting device (like a compass or alidade). This fixes the third point's position.
3.  **Traverse**: Walk a path, measuring the length and direction (bearing) of each leg.
4.  **Plotting**: Transfer these measurements to paper using a scale and a protractor/ruler.
5.  **Detailing**: Sketch in features (rivers, coastlines) relative to your fixed points.

## Materials needed

-   **Surface**: Paper, Parchment, Papyrus, Clay tablet, or Cloth.
-   **Marking**: Ink, Charcoal, Graphite.
-   **Measuring Tools**: Ropes/Chains (for distance), Compass (for direction), Ruler.
-   **Drawing Tools**: Pens, brushes, straightedge.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Topographic Map**: Uses contour lines to show elevation and terrain shape.
-   **Thematic Map**: Focuses on specific information (population, climate, resources).
-   **Nautical Chart**: Specialized for maritime navigation, showing depths and hazards.
-   **Star Chart**: A map of the night sky.

## Limits and risks

-   **Distortion**: Every flat map of a curved surface introduces distortion in either area, shape, distance, or direction.
-   **Accuracy**: A map is only as good as the survey data used to create it.
-   **Obsolescence**: Terrain and political borders change; old maps can be misleading.
-   **Bias**: Maps can be drawn to emphasize or hide certain features for political or propaganda purposes.
