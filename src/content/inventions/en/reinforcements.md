# Brief description

Structural reinforcements are support systems that stabilize excavations, tunnels, and shafts to prevent collapses and keep access safe.

## Use / Function

- **Ground stability**: Hold unstable roofs and walls.
- **Safety**: Reduce collapses and rock falls during extraction.
- **Access continuity**: Keep entry, ventilation, and evacuation routes open.
- **Depth**: Enable deeper and longer-lasting excavations.
- **Scale**: From small pits to extended tunnels.

## Operating principle

- **Load transfer**: Posts and frames redirect weight into more stable ground.
- **Confinement**: Timbering and lining keep loose material from moving.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple supports spread risk across many contact points.
- **Anchoring**: Wedges and lashings lock pieces so they do not shift.

## How to create it

1. **Assess ground**: Identify soft zones, fractures, and moisture.
2. **Choose the system**: Timber posts, A-frames, plank timbering, or stone lining.
3. **Prepare bases**: Level contact points and place wedges for tight bearing.
4. **Install supports**: Set posts and caps from the entrance toward the working face.
5. **Line the walls**: Add boards or stone to contain loose material.
6. **Technical level**: Basic for timber posts, intermediate for timbered drifts, advanced for metal sets.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for posts and frames, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** for lining, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for clamps and bracing.
- **Tools**: Hammer, saw, chisel, wedges, cordage or fiber lashings.
- **Substitutes**: Compacted earth, dry-stacked stone walls, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for lashings.

## Variants and improvements

- **Timber sets**: Posts and caps with board lining.
- **Cribs or cages**: Log boxes for soft ground.
- **Stone lining**: Masonry for stable, long-lived tunnels.
- **Metal frames**: Steel arches for high loads and long service.

## Limits and risks

- **Degradation**: Wood rots with moisture; metal corrodes.
- **Bad installation**: A poorly seated support can fail suddenly.
- **Maintenance**: Requires frequent inspection and replacement.
- **False security**: Weak supports can encourage unsafe depth.
