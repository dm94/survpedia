# Brief description

Thatching is the craft of building a roof with dry vegetation such as **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)**, water reed, sedge, rushes, heather, or palm branches, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. It is one of the oldest roofing methods and remains a viable, sustainable technique today.

## Use / Function

-   **Weather Protection:** Provides a waterproof barrier against rain and snow.
-   **Insulation:** Offers excellent thermal insulation, keeping buildings warm in winter and cool in summer (often eliminating the need for additional insulation).
-   **Sustainability:** Utilizes locally available, renewable, and biodegradable materials.
-   **Soundproofing:** Significantly reduces external noise (e.g., heavy rain).

## Operating principle

Thatching works by **gravity** and **capillary action**. The roof is built with a steep pitch (usually at least 45 degrees, preferably 50). The vegetation is laid in thick, overlapping bundles. Water does not penetrate the bundle but runs down the outer stems from one layer to the next until it drops off the eaves. The steep angle ensures water moves fast enough to prevent soaking through.

## How to create it

1.  **Preparation:** Harvest the material (reed/straw) during winter when it is dry and dormant. Clean and bundle it.
2.  **Structure:** Build a roof frame with a pitch of at least 45 degrees. Install battens or laths horizontally across the rafters.
3.  **Eaves:** Start at the bottom (eaves). Secure a heavy base layer to project over the wall, ensuring water drips clear of the foundation.
4.  **Layering:** Place bundles (courses) horizontally, working upwards. Each new layer overlaps the one below, covering the fixings.
5.  **Fixing:** Secure each course to the rafters/battens.
    -   *Traditional:* Use "spars" or "sways" made of split hazel or willow twigs twisted into staples.
    -   *Modern:* Use stainless steel wire or screw fixings.
6.  **Dressing:** Use a tool called a **Leggett** to beat the ends of the straw/reed upwards and inwards, tightening the coat and creating a smooth, even surface.
7.  **Ridging:** The peak (ridge) is the most vulnerable point. It is capped with a flexible material (often sedge or pliable straw) wrapped over the top and secured with decorative spars.
8.  **Netting:** (Optional) Cover with wire mesh to protect against birds and rodents.

## Materials needed

-   **Primary Material:**
    -   **Water Reed:** Most durable (50+ years), stiff, straight.
    -   **Wheat Straw (Long Straw or Combed Wheat Reed):** Softer, more organic look (20-30 years).
    -   **Sedge/Rushes:** Often used for the ridge.
-   **Fixings:**
    -   **[Wood](/en/materials/wood):** Hazel or willow for spars (staples) and sways (rods).
    -   **[Metal](/en/materials/metal):** Copper or steel wire.
    -   **Cord:** Tarred twine (historically).
-   **Tools:**
    -   **Leggett:** A flat, grooved paddle for dressing the thatch.
    -   **Thatching Needle:** Large needle for stitching bundles to the roof.
    -   **Shears/Knife:** For trimming edges.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Long Straw:** Has a "shaggy" appearance; the entire length of the straw is used.
-   **Combed Wheat Reed:** Straw that has been combed to remove leaves and align stems; looks smoother like water reed.
-   **Palm Thatch:** Common in tropical regions, using woven palm fronds.
-   **Fire-Retardant Sprays:** Modern chemical treatments to reduce fire risk.
-   **Fire Barriers:** Fireproof sheets installed under the thatch to protect the building structure.

## Limits and risks

-   **Fire:** The biggest risk. Dry vegetation is highly flammable. Chimneys must be well-insulated and tall.
-   **Pitch Requirement:** Cannot be used on low-pitch roofs (<45°) or it will leak and rot.
-   **Maintenance:** The ridge usually needs replacing every 10-15 years, even if the main coat lasts longer.
-   **Pests:** Birds, rats, and mice may nest in the thatch if not netted.
-   **Skill:** Requires significant skill to install correctly; poor thatching will leak quickly.
-   **Weight:** Can be heavy when wet (though lighter than slate/tile when dry), requiring a sturdy structure.
