# Brief description

A winch is a mechanical device that is used to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the tension of a [rope](/en/materials/rope) or wire rope (also called "cable" or "[wire cable](/en/materials/steel-cable)"). In its simplest form, it consists of a spool (or drum) attached to a hand crank.

## Use / Function

- **Lifting:** Raising heavy loads vertically (e.g., drawing water from a [well](/en/inventions/well), lifting construction materials).
- **Towing:** Pulling vehicles or heavy objects horizontally.
- **Tensioning:** Tightening ropes or cables on boats or structures.
- **Anchoring:** Holding a position against a strong force.

## Operating principle

The winch operates on the principle of the wheel and axle. By rotating a handle (which traces a large circle), the user turns a smaller drum. This creates mechanical advantage, allowing a small force applied over a long distance to exert a large force over a short distance.

- **Torque:** The crank arm acts as a [lever](/en/inventions/lever) to apply torque to the drum.
- **Friction:** The friction between the rope and the drum holds the load.
- **Ratchet:** A ratchet mechanism often prevents the drum from unwinding under load.

## How to create it

1.  **Frame:** Build a sturdy frame to hold the drum and axle.
2.  **Drum:** Create a cylindrical drum (spool) from [wood](/en/materials/wood) or [metal](/en/materials/metal). It needs flanges on the ends to keep the rope from sliding off.
3.  **Axle:** Insert an [axle](/en/inventions/axle) through the center of the drum and the frame.
4.  **Crank:** Attach a crank handle to the axle.
5.  **Rope:** Secure one end of the rope to the drum.
6.  **Locking Mechanism:** Install a ratchet and pawl or a simple locking pin to prevent the drum from spinning backwards when you let go of the handle.

## Materials needed

- **Frame/Drum:** Hardwood or metal.
- **Axle/Crank:** [Iron](/en/materials/iron) or [steel](/en/materials/steel) rod.
- **Rope:** Strong [hemp](/en/materials/hemp) rope or [steel cable](/en/materials/steel-cable).
- **Fasteners:** [Nails](/en/materials/nail), bolts, or joinery to hold the frame together.

## Variants and improvements

- **Windlass:** A horizontal winch used on ships to raise [anchors](/en/inventions/anchor).
- **Capstan:** A vertical-axis winch, often used on sailing ships.
- **Geared Winch:** Uses [gears](/en/inventions/gears) to further increase mechanical advantage.
- **Electric/Hydraulic Winch:** Powered by [motors](/en/inventions/electric-motor) for much higher capacity and ease of use.

## Limits and risks

- **Cable Snap:** If the cable breaks under tension, it can whip back with deadly force.
- **Freewheeling:** If the handle slips or the lock fails, the load can cause the handle to spin rapidly, causing injury ("knuckle-busting").
- **Overheating:** Continuous use can generate heat in the brake or gears.
