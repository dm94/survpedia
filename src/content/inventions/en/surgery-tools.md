# Brief description

Surgery tools are a minimal set of precision instruments used to cut, hold, and close tissue during minor procedures, usually alongside careful cleaning and sterilization.

## Use / Function

- **Wound closure**: Suturing with **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)** and a **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)**.
- **Cutting and access**: Making controlled incisions with a **[Scalpel](/en/inventions/scalpel)**.
- **Tissue handling**: Holding and positioning tissue with forceps or clamps.
- **Hemostasis**: Controlling bleeding through pressure and clamping.
- **Scale**: Field care to small clinical procedures.

## Operating principle

- **Sharp edges** focus force into a tiny area to cut cleanly.
- **Gripping surfaces** apply controlled pressure to hold tissue or needles without crushing them.
- **Leverage and geometry** provide precision and mechanical advantage.
- **Sterility** prevents infection; tools must be cleaned and disinfected before contact.

## How to create it

1. **Select the core tools**: scalpel, forceps, surgical scissors, needle holder, and a probe or retractor.
2. **Forge or stock-remove**: shape tools from steel, then grind and polish working surfaces.
3. **Heat treat**: harden and temper edges for cutting tools; keep clamps tough but not brittle.
4. **Finish and align**: smooth edges, check alignment of jaws and hinges, and remove burrs.
5. **Sterilize**: boil, use **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, or pressure steam when available.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**: **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for instruments, **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)** for dressings.
- **Cleaning and sterilization**: **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**.
- **Tools**: forge or furnace, anvil, files, sharpening stones, and hinges or rivets for articulated tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Field kit**: compact set with replaceable blades and minimal clamps.
- **Operating set**: full range of sizes with specialized instruments.
- **Stainless steel**: improved corrosion resistance and easier sterilization.
- **Disposable blades**: consistent sharpness with less maintenance.

## Limits and risks

- **Infection**: Poor sterilization can be fatal.
- **Skill limits**: Precision tools do not replace surgical training.
- **Tissue damage**: Excess force, dull edges, or poor technique can worsen injuries.
- **Pain and shock**: Procedures can cause severe trauma without anesthesia.
