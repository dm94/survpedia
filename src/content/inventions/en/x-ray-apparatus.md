# Brief description

An X-ray apparatus is the complete system that generates, shapes, and records X-ray images. It combines the X-ray tube, shielding, power supply, and detector into a safe, usable imaging setup.

## Use / Function

- **Medical imaging:** Radiography of bones, lungs, and dental structures.
- **Inspection:** Non-destructive testing of welds, castings, and assemblies.
- **Security:** Screening for hidden objects in luggage or containers.
- **Alignment:** Checking internal fit without disassembly.

## Operating principle

1. **X-ray source:** A **[Vacuum Tube](/en/inventions/vacuum-tube)** emits X-rays when accelerated electrons strike a tungsten target.
2. **Beam shaping:** Collimation narrows the beam to the area of interest.
3. **Object interaction:** Dense materials absorb more X-rays, creating contrast.
4. **Detection:** A detector or film captures the shadow image.
5. **Shielding:** Lead-lined housing blocks stray radiation.

## How to create it

1. **Assemble the tube:** Seal a glass envelope with tungsten cathode and target.
2. **Provide power:** Use a stable high-voltage supply for electron acceleration.
3. **Build the housing:** Create a steel chassis with lead shielding.
4. **Add collimation:** Include a narrow window or collimator for beam control.
5. **Install the detector:** Mount film or a digital detector opposite the source.

Minimum functional version: a sealed tube, basic high-voltage supply, simple collimation, and film. Technical level is advanced due to vacuum work, high voltage, and radiation safety.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** for the tube, **[Tungsten](/en/materials/tungsten)** for filament/target, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** for conductors.
- **Shielding:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** to block stray radiation.
- **Structure:** **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for the chassis and mounts.
- **Tools:** Vacuum pump, high-voltage insulation, alignment tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Rotating anode:** Higher power with better heat distribution.
- **Digital systems:** Faster capture with lower dose and instant review.
- **Portable units:** Battery-powered field imaging.
- **Fluoroscopy:** Real-time imaging at higher technical complexity.

## Limits and risks

- **Radiation exposure:** Requires strict shielding, distance, and time limits.
- **High voltage:** Severe electrical hazard during assembly and maintenance.
- **Heat load:** Targets overheat without cooling.
- **Image limits:** Scatter and motion blur reduce detail.
