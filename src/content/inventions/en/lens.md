# Brief description

A lens is a transparent object (usually glass or plastic) with at least one curved surface that refracts light to converge or diverge rays.

## Use / Function

- **Magnification:** Enlarging images of small objects (microscopes, magnifying glasses).
- **Far Vision:** Bringing distant objects closer (telescopes).
- **Vision Correction:** Correcting defects like myopia or hyperopia (eyeglasses).
- **Fire Starting:** Concentrating sunlight onto a point to start combustion.

## Operating principle

It relies on **refraction**. When light passes from one medium (air) to a denser one (glass) with a curved surface, it changes direction. A convex lens concentrates light at a focal point; a concave one disperses it.

## How to create it

- **Grinding:** Take a block of glass or crystal and wear it down against a concave mold using increasingly fine abrasives.
- **Polishing:** Remove grinding imperfections until transparent.
- **Casting:** Pour molten glass into a curved mold (less precise).
- **Technical Level:** Advanced. Requires precise shape control and quality abrasives.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** High-quality glass (bubble-free) or rock crystal (quartz).
- **Tools:** Iron or stone molds, abrasives (sand, emery, rouge).
- **Substitutes:** A glass sphere filled with water, a water droplet on a hydrophobic surface, carved clear ice.

## Variants and improvements

- **Simple Magnifier:** A single convex lens.
- **Compound Lens:** Combination of lenses to correct chromatic and spherical aberrations (cameras, modern telescopes).
- **Fresnel Lens:** Thinner and lighter, used in lighthouses.

## Limits and risks

- **Aberrations:** Simple lenses distort colors and shapes at the edges.
- **Fire:** A lens left in the sun can accidentally start a fire.
- **Fragility:** They scratch and break easily.
