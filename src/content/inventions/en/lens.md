# Brief description

A lens is a transparent object (usually glass, plastic, or crystal) with at least one curved surface that uses **refraction** to bend light rays, either concentrating them (converging) or spreading them out (diverging). Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another of different density.

## Use / Function

- **Magnification:** Enlarging images of small objects for detailed study (basis of the **[Microscope](/en/inventions/microscope)** and magnifying glass).
- **Far Vision:** Bringing distant objects closer to the eye (basis of the **[Telescope](/en/inventions/telescope)**).
- **Vision Correction:** Correcting refractive errors in the human eye such as myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) using **[Eyeglasses](/en/inventions/eyeglasses)**.
- **Fire Starting:** Concentrating sunlight onto a specific point (focal point) to generate intense heat and ignite tinder.

## Operating principle

The core principle is **Refraction**.

1.  **Light Speed Change:** Light travels at different speeds in different materials. It is faster in air and slower in denser materials like glass or water.
2.  **Bending:** When light enters a denser medium at an angle, it slows down and bends. When it exits, it speeds up and bends again.
3.  **Curvature:** By curving the surface of the lens, you control this bending.
    - **Convex (Converging):** Thicker in the center. Bends light inward to a single focal point. Used for magnification and starting fires.
    - **Concave (Diverging):** Thinner in the center. Bends light outward. Used for correcting nearsightedness.

## How to create it

Creating a functional lens requires patience and precision. For a detailed guide on the process, see **[Lens Grinding](/en/inventions/lens-grinding)**.

1.  **Rough Grinding:** Take a piece of clear **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz)**. Rub it against a hard, concave mold (like an iron dish) using coarse abrasive sand and water. This shapes the glass into a curve.
2.  **Fine Grinding:** Switch to finer abrasives (like fine sand or ground sandstone) to smooth out the deep scratches.
3.  **Polishing:** Use a very fine polishing powder (like **[rouge](/en/materials/iron-oxide)** or tripoli) on a piece of leather or pitch attached to the mold. Rub until the glass is perfectly transparent and scratch-free.
4.  **Casting (Alternative):** Molten glass can be poured into a heated mold, but this often results in imperfections and bubbles, making it inferior to ground lenses.

**Technical Level:** Advanced. Requires consistent motion and increasingly fine abrasives.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** High-quality, bubble-free **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** or clear **[Quartz](/en/materials/quartz)** (Rock Crystal).
- **Tools:**
  - **Molds:** Metal (iron, brass) or hard stone concave forms.
  - **Abrasives:** Coarse sand, fine sand, sandstone, emery, rouge (iron oxide).
  - **Polisher:** Leather, pitch, or felt.
- **Substitutes:**
  - **Water Sphere:** A round glass bowl filled with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** acts as a crude magnifying lens.
  - **Ice:** Clear ice can be carved into a lens shape (works only in freezing conditions).
  - **Water Drop:** A drop of water on a small hole in a plate can act as a tiny magnifier.

## Variants and improvements

- **Simple Magnifier:** A single biconvex lens (burning glass).
- **Compound Systems:** Combining multiple lenses to correct "aberrations" (color fringing or distortion). This is essential for high-quality **[Microscopes](/en/inventions/microscope)** and **[Telescopes](/en/inventions/telescope)**.
- **Fresnel Lens:** A flat lens with concentric ridges, used in lighthouses to focus light into a beam without the weight of a thick lens.

## Limits and risks

- **Aberrations:** A simple single lens will not focus all colors at the same point (chromatic aberration), causing rainbow halos around images.
- **Fire Hazard:** A convex lens left in direct sunlight can unintentionally ignite flammable materials behind it.
- **Fragility:** Glass and crystal are brittle and scratch easily, ruining their optical properties.
- **Impurities:** Bubbles or veins in the glass will distort the image significantly.
