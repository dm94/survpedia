# Brief description

Traps are mechanical devices designed to capture or kill animals by guiding movement toward a trigger that releases stored energy or a falling weight.

## Use / Function

- **Food capture:** Obtain small game for protein and fat.
- **Pest control:** Protect crops, storage, and structures.
- **Apiary protection:** Reduce rodent and predator pressure near **[Beekeeping](/en/knowledge/beekeeping)** sites.
- **Fishing:** Funnel traps, weirs, or basket traps for passive river and tidal capture.
- **Defense and alarm:** Deter intruders or signal movement.
- **Scale:** Individual, family, or small-group use.

## Operating principle

Traps combine a trigger with stored energy or gravity. The target animal applies pressure or movement to the trigger, releasing a loop, jaw, or deadfall. Placement funnels the animal into the trap’s path, and concealment reduces avoidance.

## How to create it

1. **Define the target:** Identify the animal, its size, and its travel routes.
2. **Choose a trap type:** Snare, deadfall, pitfall, or cage trap.
3. **Build the trigger:** Use a balanced peg, notch, or toggle that releases with light pressure.
4. **Set the trap:** Place on a narrow path or at a den entrance and guide movement with sticks or stones.
5. **Camouflage and stabilize:** Cover human scent and ensure the trap does not wobble.
6. **Check regularly:** Reduce suffering, prevent spoilage, and reset if needed.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frame, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** weight, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for cordage, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** thongs, **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** hooks or jaws.
- **Tools:** Knife, mallet, shovel.
- **Substitutes:** Bent saplings for spring power, **[Wire](/en/inventions/wire)** for snares, **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** for lines and anchors.

## Variants and improvements

- **Snare trap:** Loop tightens around the animal’s leg or neck.
- **Deadfall trap:** Heavy weight drops when the trigger is released.
- **Pitfall trap:** Hidden pit lined with stakes for larger animals.
- **[Grouse pit](/en/inventions/grouse-pit):** Shallow, covered pit for ground birds.
- **Cage trap:** Door closes behind the animal for live capture.
- **[Mouse trap](/en/inventions/mouse-trap):** Small snap or box trap for rodents.
- **[Fly catcher](/en/inventions/fly-catcher):** Sticky or funnel trap for flies and gnats.
- **[Kulema trap](/en/inventions/kulema-trap):** Boxed spring trap for small predators.
- **[Wolf pen trap](/en/inventions/wolf-pen-trap):** Large corral with a funnel and one-way gate for big predators.
- **[Tension snare](/en/inventions/tension-snare):** Bent sapling lifts the animal to prevent escape.
- **Fish weir:** Stakes and brush guide fish into a holding area.
- **Basket fish trap:** Funnel basket with a narrow throat that keeps fish inside.

## Limits and risks

- **Non-target capture:** Can harm pets or protected wildlife.
- **Safety:** Springs and deadfalls can injure the builder.
- **Weather:** Rain and wind can trigger or disable traps.
- **Regulation:** Local laws may restrict or ban certain traps.
