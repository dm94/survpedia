# Brief description

An arrow is a fin-stabilized projectile launched by a bow. It typically consists of a long straight shaft with a pointed tip at the front and fletching and a nock at the rear.

## Use / Function

- **Projectile**: Delivers impact or puncture force at a distance.
- **Hunting/Combat**: Designed to penetrate hide, armor, or tissue.
- **Signaling**: Can be used to send messages or carry fire (fire arrows).

## Operating principle

The arrow converts the kinetic energy transferred from the bowstring into flight. The fletching (feathers) creates aerodynamic drag at the rear, keeping the tip pointing forward (stability). The sharp point concentrates the impact force on a small area for maximum penetration.

## How to create it

1.  **Shaft**: Select a straight, lightweight shoot of wood or reed. Straighten it by heating and bending if necessary.
2.  **Nock**: Cut a small groove at the rear end to accept the bowstring.
3.  **Fletching**: Attach 3 feathers near the rear end using glue (resin) and thread. They should be equally spaced around the shaft.
4.  **Point**: Haft a sharp tip (stone, bone, or hardened wood) to the front end. Secure it with resin and binding material (sinew or plant fibers).

## Materials needed

- **Shaft**: Straight wood (cedar, pine, bamboo, reed).
- **Fletching**: Feathers (goose, turkey).
- **Point**: Flint, obsidian, bone, or simply fire-hardened wood.
- **Binding**: Sinew, thread, plant fibers.
- **Adhesive**: Pine resin, birch tar, or animal glue.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fire-hardened tip**: Simple, no separate point needed.
- **Broadhead**: Wide cutting blades for hunting (maximum bleeding).
- **Bodkin**: Narrow point for piercing armor.
- **Flu-flu**: Large feathers to limit flight distance (for bird hunting).

## Limits and risks

- **Straightness**: A warped arrow will not fly true.
- **Spine (Stiffness)**: The stiffness of the arrow must match the power of the bow (Archer's Paradox) for accuracy.
- **Durability**: Wooden shafts can break upon impact.
