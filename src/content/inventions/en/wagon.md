# Brief description

A wagon is a four-wheeled vehicle designed for transporting heavy loads, typically pulled by draft animals (horses, oxen, mules). Unlike a [cart](/en/inventions/cart), which has two wheels, a wagon is self-supporting and stable when stationary, allowing for much larger capacities.

## Use / Function

- **Heavy Transport:** Moving large quantities of goods, crops, or raw materials.
- **Migration:** Used historically for long-distance travel and carrying household goods (e.g., covered wagons).
- **Military Logistics:** Transporting supplies and ammunition.

## Operating principle

The wagon relies on four wheels to distribute weight more evenly than a cart.

- **Stability:** With four points of contact, the wagon does not tip forward or backward like a cart might.
- **Steering:** To turn, the front [axle](/en/inventions/axle) must be able to pivot relative to the frame. This requires a "fifth wheel" or a pivot pin mechanism.
- **Rolling Resistance:** Like the cart, [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel) reduce friction compared to dragging.

## How to create it

1.  **Frame:** Construct a large, sturdy rectangular frame from hardwood beams.
2.  **Rear Axle:** Fix the rear [axle](/en/inventions/axle) rigidly to the frame.
3.  **Front Axle & Steering:** Create a pivoting mechanism for the front axle. A simple version uses a central pin (kingpin) connecting the front axle assembly to the frame, allowing it to swivel.
4.  **Wheels:** Mount four sturdy [wheels](/en/inventions/wheel). Often, rear wheels are larger to carry more weight and roll easier, while front wheels are smaller to allow for tighter turns (so they don't hit the frame).
5.  **Draft Gear:** Attach a tongue or pole to the front axle assembly to connect to the animals via a [yoke](/en/inventions/yoke) or harness.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** Hardwood (oak, ash) for the frame, axles, and wheels.
- **Iron:** For the kingpin, tires, axle bearings, and structural reinforcement.
- **Leather/Rope:** For harnessing the animals.
- **Grease:** Essential for lubricating the axles and the steering pivot.

## Variants and improvements

- **Covered Wagon:** Features a canvas roof stretched over wooden hoops to protect contents from weather.
- **Carriage:** A refined wagon with suspension (springs) for transporting people comfortably.
- **Coach:** An enclosed carriage.

## Limits and risks

- **Turning Radius:** Wagons have a wider turning radius than carts. If the front wheels hit the frame (lock), the wagon cannot turn further.
- **Terrain:** Requires relatively flat and wide paths. Difficult to maneuver in dense forests or steep mountains.
- **Complexity:** The steering mechanism adds mechanical complexity and a potential failure point compared to a simple cart.
