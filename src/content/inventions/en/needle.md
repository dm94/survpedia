# Brief description

A surgical needle is a slender, sharp instrument used to pull suture material through tissue to close a wound or incision.

## Use / Function

Its primary function is to pierce tissue and guide the thread.
- **Suturing**: Joining tissues.
- **Injection**: (Hollow needles) Delivering fluids (not this type). This refers to solid suturing needles.

## Operating principle

It concentrates force at a sharp point to penetrate tissue with minimal trauma, creating a channel for the thread to follow.

## How to create it

- **Bone**: Shaping a splinter of bone and drilling an eye.
- **Metal**: Drawing steel wire, sharpening one end, and flattening/drilling the other for the eye (or swaging the thread directly).

## Materials needed

- **Steel**: For modern, sharp, durable needles.
- **Bone/Wood**: For primitive versions.

## Variants and improvements

- **Straight**: Hand-held.
- **Curved**: Used with a needle holder for deep or confined spaces.
- **Swaged**: Thread is permanently attached (no eye), causing less tissue trauma.

## Limits and risks

- **Breaking**: If bent too much.
- **Lost needle**: A major risk in surgery; can migrate in the body.
