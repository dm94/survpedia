# Brief description

Shoes are items of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. They are essential for mobility over rough terrain and protection against the elements.

## Use / Function

- **Protection:** Shields feet from sharp rocks, thorns, hot sand, and snow.
- **Insulation:** Keeps feet warm in cold climates (frostbite prevention).
- **Hygiene:** Protects against parasites (hookworms) and infections entering through the soles.
- **Traction:** Improves grip on slippery or steep surfaces.

## Operating principle

Shoes provide a durable barrier (sole) between the foot and the ground, distributing pressure and absorbing impact. The upper part secures the sole to the foot.

## How to create it

### Simple Sandals (Plant Fiber/Leather)
1.  **Sole:** Cut a piece of thick leather or weave tough plant fibers (yucca, straw) to the shape of the foot.
2.  **Straps:** Attach thongs or cords to the sole (between toes, around ankle) to hold it in place.

### Moccasins/Simple Shoes (Leather)
1.  **Pattern:** Cut a single large piece of soft leather. The foot is placed in the center.
2.  **Forming:** Gather the leather up around the foot.
3.  **Stitching:** Sew the edges together along the top or heel using an awl and sinew/thread.
4.  **Fitting:** Use a drawstring around the ankle for a tight fit.

### Complex Shoes (Sole + Upper)
1.  **Lasting:** Carve a wooden form (last) shaped like a foot.
2.  **Sole:** Cut a thick, durable sole (hard leather, wood, tire tread).
3.  **Upper:** Cut and sew softer leather pieces to form the upper shell.
4.  **Assembly:** Stitch or nail the upper to the sole, often using the last to shape it tightly.

## Materials needed

- **Sole:** Thick leather (hide), Wood, Bark, Rubber.
- **Upper:** Soft leather, Fabric, Felt.
- **Fasteners:** Laces (cord), Buckles, Buttons.
- **Tools:** Awl, Needle, Knife, Last (for advanced shoes).

## Variants and improvements

- **Sandals:** Open, breathable, good for hot climates.
- **Moccasins:** Soft, quiet, good for stealth and comfort.
- **Boots:** High-cut to protect ankles and lower legs from snakes, water, and mud.
- **Clogs:** Wooden shoes, excellent for wet/muddy conditions as they don't rot like leather.
- **Snowshoes:** specialized frames to distribute weight over snow (worn over shoes).

## Limits and risks

- **Fit:** Poorly fitting shoes cause blisters and deformities.
- **Moisture:** Wet shoes (especially leather) can lead to trench foot if not dried; they can also rot.
- **Wear:** Soles wear out and must be replaced or reinforced (hobnails).
