A spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a pointed head.

## Manufacturing

1. **Shaft selection**: Look for a straight and strong wooden branch (like ash or oak).
2. **Tip preparation**: Carve a stone (like flint or obsidian) to have sharp edges and a triangular shape.
3. **Assembly**: Make a notch at one end of the wooden pole to insert the stone tip.
4. **Fixation**: Use cord, plant fibers, or animal sinew to firmly tie the tip to the pole. Natural resin or glue is often used to reinforce the bond.
