# Brief description

A spear is a long-shafted tool with a pointed head used for hunting, fishing, and defense. Its reach and focused tip make it effective at piercing targets from a safe distance.

## Use / Function

- **Hunting**: Delivers a piercing strike against game.
- **Fishing**: Multi-prong or barbed heads secure slippery targets.
- **Defense**: Extends reach against threats.
- **Utility**: Probes water depth, mud, or vegetation.

## Operating principle

The shaft acts as a lever that amplifies reach and control. Force is concentrated at the tip, allowing penetration. Barbs or sockets resist pullout while tension is maintained.

## How to create it

1. **Select a shaft**: Choose a straight **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** pole and remove bark.
2. **Straighten and harden**: Heat gently over a fire and bend until true.
3. **Form the head**: Shape **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or bone into a sharp point or forge a metal head.
4. **Haft the point**: Cut a split or socket, insert the head, and bind tightly.
5. **Seal the binding**: Apply **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** to lock lashings and resist moisture.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Wooden shaft, stone or bone head, **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** for sealing.
- **Binding**: **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**.
- **Tools**: Knife, scraper, awl, hammerstone, fire.
- **Substitutes**: Fire-hardened wooden point or sharpened bone splinter.

## Variants and improvements

- **Thrusting spear**: Heavier head for close-range power.
- **Throwing spear**: Balanced and lighter for distance.
- **Fishing spear**: Multi-prong head for better retention.
- **Barbed head**: Backward points reduce pullout.

## Limits and risks

- **Breakage**: Impacts can snap the shaft.
- **Loosening**: Heads can work free if lashings rot.
- **Injury**: Slips during thrust can pierce hands or feet.
- **Legal limits**: Some regions restrict spears for hunting.
