# Brief description

A machine used to transform fibers (wool, flax, cotton) into thread or yarn. It uses a large **[Wheel](/en/inventions/wheel)** to rotate a **[Spindle](/en/inventions/spindle)** at high speed via a belt, significantly increasing production speed compared to a hand spindle.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use**: Rapidly spinning fibers into yarn.
- **Secondary uses**: Plying (twisting) multiple threads together to make stronger yarn.
- **Scale**: Domestic / Workshop.

## Operating principle

The spinning wheel relies on **mechanical advantage** and **angular momentum**.

1.  **Transmission**: A large wheel (drive wheel) is connected by a belt (drive band) to a much smaller pulley on the spindle mechanism.
2.  **Gear Ratio**: One rotation of the large wheel causes many rotations of the spindle.
3.  **Twist & Draw**: The rotation twists the fibers while the user drafts (pulls) them out.
4.  **Winding**: In simpler wheels (Great Wheel), spinning and winding are separate steps. In treadle wheels with a flyer, twisting and winding happen simultaneously.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Charkha / Hand-turned Wheel)

1.  **Base**: A stable **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frame.
2.  **Wheel**: A large hoop or solid disk mounted on an axle.
3.  **Spindle Unit**: A horizontal spindle mounted on bearings, with a small pulley (whorl).
4.  **Belt**: A cord or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** strap connecting the large wheel to the spindle pulley.

### Technical level

Intermediate. Requires precise carpentry for the wheel and bearings.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**: For the frame, wheel spokes, and rim.
  - **Axle material**: Hardwood or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** rod.
  - **Belt**: **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** strap, strong cord, or gut.
  - **Lubricant**: **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** or vegetable oil for the axle bearings.
- **Tools**:
  - Saw, Chisel, Drill/Auger.
  - Measuring tools.

## Variants and improvements

- **Great Wheel (Walking Wheel)**: Large wheel turned by hand. The spinner walks back to draw the thread and forward to wind it. Simple mechanism, high speed.
- **Saxony Wheel (Treadle Wheel)**: Adds a **foot treadle** (leaving hands free) and a **flyer** mechanism (twists and winds simultaneously). Continuous action.
- **Charkha**: Portable, horizontal floor wheel.

## Limits and risks

- **Complexity**: Harder to build and maintain than a drop spindle.
- **Portability**: Much larger and heavier than a spindle.
- **Maintenance**: Bearings need lubrication; belts stretch and need adjustment.
- **Fingers**: Moving parts can pinch fingers or catch loose clothing.
