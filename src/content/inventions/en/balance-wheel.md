# Brief description

The balance wheel is the timekeeping element used in portable mechanical timepieces, such as watches and marine chronometers. It acts as a harmonic oscillator, swinging back and forth, analogous to a pendulum in a stationary clock.

## Use / Function

-   **Portable Timekeeping:** Allows clocks to function correctly while moving, tilted, or being carried (unlike pendulums which require a fixed, level position).
-   **Regulation:** Determines the accuracy of the watch by oscillating at a constant frequency.

## Operating principle

The balance wheel works in conjunction with a hairspring (balance spring).

1.  **Oscillation:** The wheel rotates in one direction, winding the hairspring.
2.  **Restoring Force:** The tension in the spring stops the wheel and pushes it back in the opposite direction.
3.  **Inertia:** The wheel's momentum carries it past the resting point, winding the spring in the other direction.
4.  **Isochronism:** Ideally, the time it takes to complete one swing is constant, regardless of how far it swings (amplitude).

## How to create it

1.  **Wheel:** Fabricate a lightweight, perfectly balanced wheel. The rim is often heavier to increase inertia.
2.  **Hairspring:** Coil a very fine strip of spring steel or bronze into a spiral. Attach the inner end to the wheel's axis (collet) and the outer end to a fixed stud.
3.  **Poising:** Test the wheel on knife-edges. Remove material from heavy spots to ensure gravity does not affect its rate when the watch is in different positions.

## Materials needed

-   **Wheel:** **[Brass](/en/materials/brass)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
-   **Hairspring:** **[Spring Steel](/en/materials/spring-steel)**, Phosphor Bronze, or specialized alloys resistant to temperature changes.
-   **Pivots:** Hardened **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** running in **[Ruby](/en/materials/ruby)** bearings.

## Variants and improvements

-   **Bimetallic Balance:** The rim is made of two metals (brass and steel) fused together. It curls as temperature changes to compensate for the hairspring's changing elasticity.
-   **Glucydur Balance:** Made of a beryllium-bronze alloy that is hard, non-magnetic, and stable.
-   **Free Sprung Balance:** Regulated by adjusting inertia weights on the rim rather than changing the effective length of the spring.

## Limits and risks

-   **Temperature:** Heat makes the spring softer and the wheel larger, slowing the watch. Compensation is required for high accuracy.
-   **Magnetism:** Steel hairsprings can become magnetized, causing the coils to stick together and the watch to run wildly fast.
-   **Shock:** The pivots are extremely thin (like a hair) and can break if dropped. Shock protection systems (spring-loaded jewels) are needed.
