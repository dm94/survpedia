# Brief description

A sled is a land vehicle that slides across a surface, usually usually having runners or a flat bottom. It is designed to transport people or goods across low-friction surfaces like snow, ice, mud, or wet grass, although early sleds were also used on sand (Ancient Egypt).

## Use / Function

- **Transport:** Moving heavy loads or people over terrain where wheels would sink or get stuck (deep snow, soft mud).
- **Logistics:** Essential for arctic or winter survival/travel.
- **Recreation:** Sliding down hills for sport.

## Operating principle

The sled works by distributing the load's weight over a surface area that slides rather than rolls.

- **Runners:** Narrow strips (skis) reduce the contact area, minimizing friction on hard ice or packed snow.
- **Flat Bottom (Toboggan):** Maximizes surface area to "float" on top of deep, soft snow, preventing the vehicle from sinking.
- **Lashing:** Traditional sleds use flexible lashings ([rope](/en/inventions/rope), **[leather](/en/materials/leather)**) instead of rigid nails. This allows the sled to flex and twist over uneven terrain without breaking.

## How to create it

### Basic Runner Sled (Komartik style)

1.  **Runners:** Select two long, sturdy poles or planks. If using wood, they can be steam-bent at the front to glide over obstacles.
2.  **Shoeing (Optional):** Attach bone, antler, or a layer of frozen mud/ice to the bottom of the runners to reduce friction and protect the wood.
3.  **Crossbars:** Lay wooden crosspieces across the runners.
4.  **Lashing:** Lash the crossbars to the runners using [rope](/en/inventions/rope) or raw hide. Do _not_ use rigid joinery (nails/screws) if traversing rough terrain; flexibility is key.
5.  **Decking:** Add a platform of slats or hide on top of the crossbars to hold the load.

## Materials needed

- **Wood:** For runners and crossbars (Ash, Birch, or Spruce are good choices).
- **Bone/Antler:** For runner shoes (harder and slicker than wood).
- **Lashing:** Rope, rawhide strips, or sinew.
- **Lubricant:** Mud mixed with water (frozen), fat, or oil for the runners.

## Variants and improvements

- **Toboggan:** A flat-bottomed sled made of curled planks, used for deep soft snow.
- **Travois:** A simple A-frame drag used by indigenous peoples, dragged by a horse or dog.
- **Sledge:** Heavy-duty sled for hauling stones or timber.
- **Pulka:** A low-slung small sled used for sport or transport, pulled by a skier or dog.

## Limits and risks

- **Friction:** Requires a low-friction surface. Useless on dry pavement or rocky ground (high wear).
- **Control:** Harder to steer and brake than wheeled vehicles.
- **Terrain:** Can tip over on steep side-slopes.
