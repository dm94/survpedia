# Brief description

A hand axe is a prehistoric stone tool, characteristically bifacial (worked on both sides) and almond or teardrop-shaped. It is considered the "Swiss Army knife" of the Stone Age due to its versatility. It is held directly in the hand, without a handle.

## Use / Function

- **Cutting:** Butchering animals and cutting meat.
- **Chopping:** Cutting wood or hacking through vegetation.
- **Digging:** Loosening soil to find roots or tubers.
- **Scraping:** Preparing hides (though less specialized than a scraper).

## Operating principle

**Wedge:** The hand axe functions as a wedge. The sharp edges concentrate force to separate material, while the weight of the stone provides momentum for chopping.

## How to create it

1.  **Selection:** Find a suitable nodule of flint, chert, obsidian, or other hard, fracture-prone stone.
2.  **Roughing out:** Use a hard hammerstone (a rounded river stone) to strike off large flakes from the nodule, creating a rough shape.
3.  **Shaping:** Use a softer hammer (antler, bone, or softer stone) to thin the tool and refine the shape, working on both faces (bifacial knapping) to create a sharp edge all around.
4.  **Finishing:** Use pressure flaking (pressing with an antler tip) to sharpen and straighten the edge.

## Materials needed

- **Core Stone:** Flint, chert, obsidian, quartzite, or basalt.
- **Hammerstone:** A hard, rounded stone for initial percussion.
- **Soft Hammer:** Antler billet, bone, or hard wood for thinning.
- **Pressure Flaker:** Antler tine or copper tip for fine detailing.

## Variants and improvements

- **Oldowan Chopper:** Earlier, simpler tool with only one worked edge.
- **Acheulean Hand Axe:** The classic teardrop shape, symmetrical and carefully worked.
- **Mousterian:** Smaller, more refined tools made from prepared cores (Levallois technique).
- **Hafted Axe:** Later versions attached to a wooden handle for greater leverage (evolves into the modern axe).

## Limits and risks

- **Range:** Requires close contact with the target (no handle).
- **Safety:** Can cut the user's hand if not held correctly or if the edge is not dulled near the grip.
- **Durability:** Stone is brittle and can shatter if struck against a hard surface incorrectly.
