# Brief description

Flint and pyrite ignition is a percussion method that creates sparks by striking flint against pyrite, lighting prepared tinder.

## Use / Function

- **Primary use:** Produce sparks to ignite tinder.
- **Secondary uses:** Portable fire starting without friction drilling.
- **Scale:** Individual.

## Operating principle

Hard impacts scrape tiny metal-rich particles from pyrite. These particles heat rapidly in air and become sparks that can ignite dry, fine tinder.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare tinder:** Use very dry, finely shredded fibers or charred plant material.
2. **Hold pyrite:** Grasp the pyrite with a sharp edge exposed.
3. **Strike with flint:** Hit the pyrite sharply to shower sparks onto the tinder.
4. **Ignite:** Once a spark catches, nurture it into an ember and blow into flame.
5. **Technical level:** Basic.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Flint, pyrite, dry tinder.
- **Tools:** A stone or bone striker for handling comfort.
- **Substitutes:** Flint and steel if steel is available.

## Variants and improvements

- **Spark catcher:** A shallow bark tray to hold tinder.
- **Charred fibers:** Increase catch reliability.
- **Compact kit:** Small flint and pyrite pieces for portability.

## Limits and risks

- **Tinder quality:** Requires extremely dry, fine tinder.
- **Weather dependence:** Wind and humidity reduce success.
- **Hand injury:** Sharp edges can cut skin.
