# Brief description

A milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool used in **[Milling Machines](/en/inventions/milling-machine)** to remove material from a workpiece. Unlike a **[Drill Bit](/en/inventions/drill-bit)**, which cuts only at the tip, a milling cutter can cut with its sides, allowing for the machining of flat surfaces, slots, and complex contours.

## Use / Function

- **Surface Machining**: Flattening blocks of material (facing).
- **Slotting**: Cutting channels or keyways (slot milling).
- **Contouring**: Creating complex shapes following a profile.
- **Scale**: From micro-machining to large industrial mills.

## Operating principle

The cutter rotates at high speed and has multiple cutting edges (teeth or flutes). As the workpiece is fed against the rotating cutter, each tooth shears off a small chip of material.

- **Peripheral Cutting**: Teeth on the circumference cut while the tool moves laterally.
- **Face Cutting**: Teeth on the end cut when the tool plunges or faces.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version

A hardened steel bar with hand-filed teeth (before hardening) can work for soft materials like wood or plastic.

### Advanced version (High Speed Steel - HSS)

1.  **Turning**: A high-speed steel bar is turned to the basic shape.
2.  **Flute Milling**: Another milling machine (or dividing head) is used to cut the helical grooves that form the cutting edges.
3.  **Hardening**: The steel is heated and tempered to achieve maximum hardness without being too brittle.
4.  **Sharpening**: The cutting edges are precision ground using abrasive wheels.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**:
  - **High Speed Steel (HSS)**: Steel alloy with tungsten, chromium, and vanadium that maintains hardness at high temperatures.
  - **Tungsten Carbide**: For modern high-performance tools, harder but more brittle.
- **Tools**: **[Lathe](/en/inventions/lathe)**, **[Milling Machine](/en/inventions/milling-machine)** (to make complex cutters), **[Grinding Wheel](/en/inventions/grinding-wheel)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **End Mill**: Cuts with the end and sides; most common for slots and profiles.
- **Face Mill**: Large diameter, for flattening large surfaces quickly.
- **Ball Nose**: Rounded tip for 3D machining and curved surfaces.
- **Form Cutter**: Custom profile (e.g., for cutting gears).

## Limits and risks

- **Wear**: Edges dull with use, increasing friction and heat.
- **Deflection**: If the cutter is long and thin, it can bend under load, causing inaccuracies.
- **Breakage**: If fed too fast or the cutter jams, it can break violently.
- **Heat**: Cutting generates significant heat; coolant is often required.
