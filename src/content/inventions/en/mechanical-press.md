# Brief description

A mechanical press is a machine tool that changes the shape of a workpiece by the application of pressure. It is fundamental to manufacturing, allowing for the precise and consistent shaping of materials, particularly metals.

## Use / Function

- **Forging:** Shaping metal by compressive force.
- **Stamping:** Cutting or embossing flat sheet metal.
- **Bending:** Deforming material into a desired angle or shape.
- **Shearing:** Cutting material using a blade driven by the press.
- **Scale:** From small workshop fly presses to massive industrial power presses.

## Operating Principle

The mechanical press transforms rotational motion (often from a motor or manual flywheel) into linear motion to drive a "ram" or "slide" against a workpiece placed on a stationary "bed."
- **Energy Storage:** A flywheel stores rotational kinetic energy.
- **Transmission:** A mechanism (screw, crank, eccentric shaft, or toggle) converts the rotation into a powerful linear stroke.
- **Impact/Pressure:** The ram delivers the stored energy to the workpiece in a controlled manner.

## How to create it

1.  **Frame Construction:** Build a rigid, heavy frame (C-frame or O-frame) that can withstand high reaction forces without deforming.
2.  **Drive Mechanism:**
    - **Screw Press:** Install a large vertical screw through a threaded collar in the frame. Attach a handle or flywheel to the top.
    - **Crank Press:** Mount a crankshaft and connecting rod to drive the ram up and down.
3.  **Ram and Bed:** Install a guided sliding block (ram) at the bottom of the mechanism and a solid table (bed) below it.
4.  **Tooling:** Attach the specific punch (to the ram) and die (to the bed) for the desired operation.

## Materials needed

- **Frame:** Cast iron or welded steel plates for rigidity; heavy timber for primitive versions.
- **Mechanism:** Hardened steel for screws, cranks, and gears; bronze for bushings/bearings.
- **Flywheel:** Heavy iron wheel to store momentum.
- **Tooling:** Tool steel (hardened and tempered) to resist wear and deformation.

## Variants and improvements

- **Screw Press:** Uses a screw to drive the ram (e.g., Gutenberg's printing press, coining press). Slow but high force.
- **Fly Press:** A screw press with a weighted flywheel for impact.
- **Crank/Eccentric Press:** Uses a rotating shaft to drive the ram. Faster, used for punching/blanking.
- **Knuckle-Joint Press:** Uses a toggle mechanism for very high force at the bottom of the stroke (coining).
- **Hydraulic Press:** Uses fluid pressure instead of mechanical linkages (modern variant).

## Limits and risks

- **Crushing Hazard:** Extremely dangerous to hands and fingers. Requires safety guards.
- **Frame Failure:** If the press is overloaded, the frame can crack or shatter.
- **Energy Limit:** Mechanical presses rely on stored flywheel energy; if the cut is too hard, the press may stall.
