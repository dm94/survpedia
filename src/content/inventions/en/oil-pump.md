# Brief description

An oil pump is a pump adapted to move viscous petroleum liquids and residues safely and steadily. It is optimized for thick fluids that do not flow well by gravity.

## Use / Function

- **Transfer crude**: Move crude oil between settling tanks and stills.
- **Handle heavy fractions**: Move warm bitumen or heavy residues.
- **Process control**: Maintain steady feed during refining.
- **Spill recovery**: Lift oil from pits or sumps.
- **Scale**: Workshop and industrial.

## Operating principle

Oil pumps usually rely on **positive displacement** so thick fluids move at low speed without losing prime.

1. **Inlet**: Oil enters the pump chamber through a check valve or inlet port.
2. **Sealing**: Tight clearances or flexible seals prevent backflow.
3. **Displacement**: A piston, gear, or screw pushes oil toward the outlet.
4. **Outlet**: The outlet valve opens as pressure rises, sending oil to the line.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (piston oil pump)

1. **Cylinder**: Use a metal tube with a smooth interior.
2. **Piston and seal**: Fit a piston wrapped in **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** and lubricated with **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**.
3. **Valves**: Add two one-way valves to control intake and discharge.
4. **Short suction line**: Keep the inlet pipe short and wide to reduce flow resistance.
5. **Warming**: Warm the pump body and inlet line to reduce oil viscosity.

### Required technological level

Intermediate. Basic metalwork and valve fitting are needed for reliable seals.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** or **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** body, piston, valves, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** seals, **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** lubricant.
- **Tools**: Drill or auger, file, hammer, and a heat source for fitting.
- **Possible substitutes**: Hardwood body lined with clay, rope packing for seals, manual lever drive.

## Variants and improvements

- **Gear pump**: Smooth flow and strong suction for warm oil.
- **Screw pump**: Excellent for very viscous residues.
- **Double-acting piston**: Increases output without increasing size.
- **Heated jacket**: Keeps heavy fractions flowing.

## Limits and risks

- **Viscosity**: Cold oil can stall the pump or tear seals.
- **Leakage**: Poor seals allow air in and reduce output.
- **Fire risk**: Warm oil and vapors are flammable.
- **Wear**: Abrasive grit in crude oil shortens valve life.
