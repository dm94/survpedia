# Brief description

Distillation is a physical process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation.

It allows you to purify water, concentrate alcohol for medical or fuel use, and extract essential oils from plants.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is separation and purification:

- **Water Purification**: Removing salts, bacteria, and impurities (desalination).
- **Alcohol Concentration**: Increasing ethanol content beyond what fermentation can achieve (for antiseptics, fuel, spirits, **[Rectified Spirits](/en/materials/rectified-spirits)**).
- **Extraction**: Obtaining essential oils and perfumes from plants.
- **Refining**: Separating crude oil into useful fractions (advanced).

## Operating principle

The core principle is the difference in boiling points of various substances.

1.  **Heating**: The mixture is heated.
2.  **Vaporization**: The component with the lower boiling point turns into vapor first (e.g., Alcohol at ~78°C, Water at 100°C).
3.  **Transport**: The vapor travels away from the heat source.
4.  **Condensation**: The vapor is cooled (usually by passing through a tube cooled by water or air) and turns back into a liquid.
5.  **Collection**: The condensed liquid (distillate) is collected in a separate container.

## How to create it

### Minimum functional version (Solar Still)

1.  **Dig a hole**: In the ground.
2.  **Place container**: In the center.
3.  **Fill**: Put impure water/vegetation around the container (not inside).
4.  **Cover**: Plastic sheet over the hole, weighed down with a stone in the center (over the container).
5.  **Wait**: Sun evaporates water, it condenses on the plastic and drips into the container.

### Functional version (Pot Still)

1.  **Boiler**: A pot with a lid that seals well (use dough to seal gaps).
2.  **Condenser**: A copper tube or bamboo pipe coming out of the lid.
3.  **Cooling**: The tube passes through a container of cold water or is long enough to air cool.
4.  **Receiver**: A vessel to catch the drips.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials**:
  - **Heat Source**: Fire, sun.
  - **Vessels**: Boiler and receiver (Clay, Metal, Glass).
  - **Condenser**: Tube (Copper is best for heat transfer and removing sulfur compounds; Glass; Bamboo).
- **Tools**:
  - **Sealing material**: Flour paste, clay, or cork to prevent steam loss.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fractional Distillation**: Using a column to separate liquids with close boiling points.
- **Steam Distillation**: Passing steam through material (plants) to carry volatile oils.
- **Reflux**: Allowing some vapor to condense and fall back to increase purity.

## Limits and risks

- **Explosions**: A blocked system creates a pressure bomb. ALWAYS ensure the path is open.
- **Methanol**: In alcohol distillation, the "foreshots" (first part) can contain methanol, which is toxic (blindness/death). Discard the first portion.
- **Burns**: Steam causes severe burns.
- **Material Safety**: Don't use lead solder or toxic materials in the construction.
