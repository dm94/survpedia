Silver is a chemical element with symbol Ag and atomic number 47. It is a soft, white, lustrous transition metal with the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. It occurs as native silver, in gold-silver alloys, and in ores such as argentite and chlorargyrite.

## Properties

Silver is highly conductive, malleable, and ductile, and it tarnishes when exposed to sulfur compounds.

## Extraction Process

Silver is mined from native deposits or from ores such as argentite and galena, often as a byproduct of lead, zinc, or copper. The ore is crushed, concentrated, and smelted to produce a silver-bearing bullion. Refining is done by cupellation (oxidizing and removing lead) or by electrolytic refining to reach high purity.
