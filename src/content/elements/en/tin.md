Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. It is a soft, silvery post-transition metal in group 14, known for its low melting point and corrosion resistance. Tin commonly forms +2 and +4 oxidation states and is widely used in alloys and protective coatings.

## Properties

- Phase: Solid
- Density: 7.365 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 505.08 K
- Boiling Point: 2875 K

## Uses

- Bronze and pewter alloys
- Soldering and joining metals
- Tin plating for corrosion protection
- Food-safe containers and coatings
- Low-melting alloys for casting

## Extraction Process

Tin is commonly obtained from cassiterite (SnO₂). The ore is crushed and washed to concentrate heavy minerals, then smelted with charcoal in a furnace to reduce the oxide to metal. The molten tin is refined to remove impurities and improve purity for alloying or coating applications.
