Aluminium (aluminum) is a lightweight, silvery-white metal in the boron group with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is the most abundant metal in Earth's crust and forms a thin, protective oxide layer that resists corrosion.

## Properties

- Phase: Solid
- Density: 2.7 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 933.47 K
- Boiling Point: 2743 K
- Lightweight with a high strength-to-weight ratio when alloyed
- Good thermal and electrical conductivity
- Non-magnetic and highly malleable

## Uses

- Aircraft, vehicles, and lightweight structural alloys
- Packaging (cans, foil) and food storage
- Electrical transmission lines and bus bars
- Construction materials (frames, panels, roofing)
- Heat sinks and thermal management components

## Extraction Process

Aluminium is produced primarily from bauxite. The Bayer process refines bauxite into alumina (aluminum oxide), which is then reduced to metal using the Hall-Héroult electrolytic process in molten cryolite. The resulting aluminum is cast into ingots or further alloyed depending on the application.
