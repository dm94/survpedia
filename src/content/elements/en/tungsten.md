Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a dense transition metal with the highest melting point of any metal. Its extreme heat resistance and strength make it essential for high-temperature tools, electronics, and radiation applications.

## Properties
- Phase: Solid
- Density: 19.25 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 3695 K
- Boiling Point: 6203 K
- Very high hardness and tensile strength at elevated temperatures
- Brittle at room temperature in pure form
- Excellent thermal and electrical conductivity for a refractory metal

## Uses
- Light bulb and vacuum tube filaments
- X-ray tube targets and shielding components
- Tungsten carbide cutting tools and wear-resistant parts
- High-temperature electrodes (TIG welding)
- Counterweights and radiation shielding due to high density
- Alloying for high-speed steels and superalloys

## Extraction Process

Tungsten is obtained from wolframite and scheelite ores. The ore is crushed and concentrated, then chemically converted to soluble tungstates. The tungstate is purified and reduced at high temperature with hydrogen or carbon to produce tungsten powder, which is then sintered or pressed into solid parts.
