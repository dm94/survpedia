Zinc (also called spelter in commerce) is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. Zinc is chemically similar to magnesium; its ion has a comparable size and its most common oxidation state is +2.

## Properties

- Phase: Solid
- Density: 7.14 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 692.68 K
- Boiling Point: 1180 K

## Uses

- Galvanizing iron and steel to prevent rust
- Brass and other zinc alloys
- Primary batteries (zinc-carbon, alkaline)
- Die casting and hardware components
- Nutritional and agricultural supplements

## Extraction Process

Zinc is usually extracted from sphalerite (zinc sulfide). The ore is roasted in air to form zinc oxide, then reduced with carbon in retorts at high temperature. The zinc vapor is condensed into metal; modern processes often use leaching and electrolysis for higher purity.
