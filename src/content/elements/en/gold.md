## Extraction Process

Gold occurs as native metal in placer deposits and in quartz or sulfide ore veins. Placer gold is separated by gravity methods like panning and sluicing. Hard-rock ore is crushed, concentrated, and smelted, then refined by cupellation or chemical parting to remove silver and base-metal impurities.
