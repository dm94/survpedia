## Extraction Process

Platinum is typically found with other platinum-group metals in sulfide ores or as heavy grains in placer deposits. Ore is crushed and concentrated, smelted into a sulfide matte, then chemically refined. The platinum-group metals are separated using dissolution and selective precipitation, followed by high-temperature refining to reach high purity.
