Lead (/lɛd/) is a chemical element in the carbon group with symbol Pb (from Latin:plumbum) and atomic number 82. Lead is a soft, malleable and heavy post-transition metal. Metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut, but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air.

## Properties
- Phase: Solid
- Density: 11.34 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 600.61 K
- Boiling Point: 2022 K

## Uses
- Batteries (lead-acid)
- Radiation shielding
- Ammunition (bullets)
- Weights and sinkers
- Plumb bobs
- Soldering (historical, less common now due to toxicity)

## Extraction Process

Lead is mainly obtained from galena (lead sulfide). The ore is crushed and roasted in air to form lead oxide, then smelted with carbon in a furnace to produce molten lead. The metal is refined to remove impurities such as silver, copper, and sulfur.
