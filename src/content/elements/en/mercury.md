Mercury is a chemical element with symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum (/haɪˈdrɑːrdʒərəm/). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.

## Properties
- Phase: Liquid

## Uses
- **Thermometers and barometers**: Historical instruments for temperature and pressure.
- **[Mirror](/en/inventions/mirror)**: Tin-mercury silvering in antique glass mirrors.
- **[Gold](/en/materials/gold)**: Amalgamation to extract gold (toxic, avoid when possible).
- **[Pigments](/en/materials/pigments)**: Cinnabar/vermilion reds (highly toxic).
- **Electrical switches**: Liquid contacts in specialized relays and tilt switches.

## Extraction Process

Mercury is most often obtained from cinnabar (HgS).

- **Roast the ore**: Heat cinnabar in a closed vessel to release mercury vapor.
- **Condense**: Lead the vapor into a cooled retort or pipe to liquefy it.
- **Collect and store**: Gather the liquid metal, often stored under water to reduce oxidation and vapor loss.
