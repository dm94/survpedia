Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin:ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.

## Properties

- Phase: Solid
- Density: 7.874 g/cm³
- Melting Point: 1811 K
- Boiling Point: 3134 K

## Uses

- Steel production
- Construction and infrastructure
- Machinery and tools
- Transportation (rails, ships, vehicles)

## Extraction Process

Iron is mainly obtained from hematite and magnetite ores. The ore is crushed, concentrated, and reduced with carbon in a blast furnace to produce pig iron. The molten metal is then refined (removing carbon and impurities) to make wrought iron or steel depending on the desired properties.
