# Brief description

Labor is the sequence of physical stages that move the baby through the birth canal, driven by contractions, positioning, and controlled support. It focuses on safe progression, hygiene, and early recognition of complications.

## Use / Function

- **Progression**: Open the cervix and allow descent.
- **Protection**: Reduce tearing with controlled support.
- **Safety**: Monitor signs of distress in mother and baby.
- **Decision making**: Identify when help or transfer is needed.
- **Scale**: Home to small community settings.

## Operating principle

- **Contractions**: Rhythmic uterine pressure opens the cervix and moves the baby.
- **Alignment**: Pelvic position and fetal posture reduce resistance.
- **Fluid and energy**: Hydration and steady breathing support endurance.
- **Heat and hygiene**: Clean, warm environment reduces infection and cold stress.
- **Observation**: Regular checks guide timing and interventions.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare a clean space**: Wash hands, surfaces, and cloths; set warm wraps.
2. **Support positioning**: Use upright or side positions; avoid prolonged flat lying.
3. **Manage pace**: Encourage breathing, hydration, and short rests.
4. **Protect tissues**: Apply gentle support as the head crowns; do not force.
5. **Monitor continuously**: Track contraction rhythm, bleeding, and maternal alertness.
6. **Plan for escalation**: Know when to call trained help or transfer.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Safe labor support requires hygiene, observation, and experience.

## Materials needed

- **Essential hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**.
- **Support and comfort**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for a stool or bench, warm cloths, clean wraps.
- **Hygiene tools**: **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** for surface cleaning when available.
- **Emergency ties**: **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)** or **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for clean ties.
- **Skin protection**: **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** or **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** in small amounts for gentle protective salves.

## Variants and improvements

- **Upright labor**: Standing, squatting, or supported kneeling improves gravity help.
- **Birth stool**: Stable seat to reduce fatigue and improve alignment.
- **Warm compresses**: Gentle warmth to reduce discomfort and improve relaxation.
- **Sterile kit**: Pre-cleaned cloths and ties to reduce infection risk.
- **Support team**: One person focused on comfort, one on monitoring.

## Limits and risks

- **Prolonged labor**: Exhaustion, dehydration, and rising risk of complications.
- **Obstructed labor**: Mispositioned baby can stop progress and endanger both.
- **Hemorrhage**: Sudden bleeding requires urgent action.
- **Infection**: Unclean hands or tools increase postpartum risk.
- **Newborn distress**: Poor breathing or cold stress needs immediate care.
