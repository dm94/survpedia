# Brief description

Leathercraft is the skill of cutting, shaping, and stitching leather to make durable goods such as belts, sheaths, pouches, straps, and containers.

## Use / Function

- **Protection**: Tough coverings for tools, hands, and gear.
- **Containment**: Bags, pouches, and cases that hold shape.
- **Fastening**: Straps, belts, ties, and lashings.
- **Repair**: Reinforcing worn items and replacing broken seams.
- **Scale**: Personal to small workshop.

## Operating principle

- **Fiber structure**: Interlocked collagen fibers resist tearing when stitched correctly.
- **Controlled perforation**: Holes made with an **[Awl](/en/inventions/awl)** guide the stitch without cutting the grain.
- **Thread locking**: Waxed **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)** grips the hole and resists moisture.
- **Conditioning**: Oils and waxes keep leather flexible and water-resistant.

## How to create it

1. **Select leather**: Choose thickness and firmness for the item. If using rawhide, **[tan](/en/knowledge/tanning)** it first.
2. **Plan and mark**: Trace the pattern and stitch lines, leaving seam allowance.
3. **Cut and prep**: Cut panels cleanly, thin edges where needed, and smooth the grain.
4. **Punch holes**: Use an **[Awl](/en/inventions/awl)** to open consistent stitch spacing.
5. **Stitch**: Sew with **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)** and waxed thread.
6. **Shape and finish**: Wet-form if needed, then burnish edges, oil, and seal.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Stitching and finishing raise the skill level.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**, **[Yarn](/en/materials/yarn)** or **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for thread.
- **Conditioning and sealing**: **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)**, **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**, **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**.
- **Tools**: **[Awl](/en/inventions/awl)**, **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)**, **[Scissors](/en/inventions/scissors)**, **[Scraper](/en/inventions/scraper)**, simple wood or bone formers.
- **Possible substitutes**: Rawhide for stiff items, woven fabric for panels, fiber cordage for stitching.

## Variants and improvements

- **Lacing**: Edge lacing for fast assembly and easy repair.
- **Saddle stitch**: Strong, hand-stitched seams that resist failure.
- **Wet-molding**: Forming sheaths and cases to precise shapes.
- **Reinforced seams**: Riveted or doubled layers for heavy load points.
- **Surface finishes**: Dyed, waxed, or oiled for weather resistance.

## Limits and risks

- **Moisture damage**: Unsealed leather molds and weakens over time.
- **Stitch failure**: Poor spacing or thin thread leads to seam tearing.
- **Over-drying**: Excess heat makes leather brittle.
- **Tool injury**: Awls and needles can puncture hands.
