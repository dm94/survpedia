# Brief description

Anesthesia is the controlled reduction of pain and awareness so procedures can be performed with less stress, safer handling, and better outcomes.

## Use / Function

- **Pain control**: Reduce or block pain signals during procedures.
- **Stillness**: Limit reflex movement for precision work.
- **Access**: Enable careful cleaning, repair, or extraction when needed.
- **Stress reduction**: Lower fear and physiological stress responses.
- **Scale**: From a single person to small clinical settings.

## Operating principle

- **Local blockade**: Numbing agents interrupt nerve signals near the site.
- **Sedation**: Depresses the central nervous system to reduce awareness.
- **Support**: Monitoring keeps breathing and circulation safe.
- **Timing**: Effect depends on dose, route, and body response.

## How to create it

1. **Assess the need**: Match the anesthesia level to the procedure and risk.
2. **Prepare the space**: Clean hands, tools, and surfaces; organize materials.
3. **Choose the safest option**: Prefer local control and minimal sedation.
4. **Use known agents only**: Avoid unknown chemicals or improvised mixtures.
5. **Monitor continuously**: Watch breathing, alertness, and skin color.
6. **Observe recovery**: Keep the person under supervision until stable.

### Required technological level

Intermediate to advanced. Safe anesthesia depends on training, hygiene, and monitoring.

## Materials needed

- **Essential hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
- **Procedure tools**: **[Surgery Tools](/en/inventions/surgery-tools)**, **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)**.
- **Stabilization**: **[Surgical Thread](/en/materials/surgical-thread)** or **[Plant Fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for ties and support.

## Variants and improvements

- **Topical numbing**: Surface-level pain control.
- **Local infiltration**: Focused numbness around a site.
- **Regional block**: Larger area control with careful placement.
- **Sedation**: Reduced awareness for short procedures when monitored.
- **Combined approach**: Local control plus minimal sedation for safer comfort.

## Limits and risks

- **Airway risk**: Deep sedation can slow or stop breathing.
- **Allergy and toxicity**: Reactions vary widely between people.
- **Infection**: Poor hygiene increases complications.
- **Under-control**: Inadequate pain control can cause harm and panic.
- **Skill limits**: Do not attempt without training and monitoring.
