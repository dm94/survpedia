Antigens are molecular patterns that the immune system can recognize and respond to. They are often parts of microbes, toxins, or other foreign substances that trigger antibody binding and immune memory.

## Description of what it is like

Antigens are usually proteins, glycoproteins, or polysaccharides. They are not a single substance but a class of molecules defined by how immune receptors bind to specific shapes (epitopes).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: On the surface of bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, pollen, and some animal or food proteins.
- **Signs**: Not visible to the eye; identified by immune reactions or lab tests.
- **Natural**: Present wherever living organisms or biological materials exist.

### Minimum processing required

- **Collection**: Obtain biological source material (cultures, tissue, or secreted toxins).
- **Inactivation**: Heat, chemicals, or radiation to reduce infectious risk when needed.
- **Separation**: Filtration or precipitation to enrich the antigen fraction.
- **Stabilization**: Drying, cold storage, or buffering to preserve structure.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Clean containers**: Glass or stainless for sterile handling.
- **Filters**: Cloth or paper for coarse separation.
- **Heat source**: Controlled heat for inactivation.
- **Cold storage**: Cool place or ice to slow degradation.

### Common forms of use

- **Inactivated whole organisms**: Killed microbes used for immunization or study.
- **Subunit antigens**: Purified proteins or polysaccharides.
- **Toxoids**: Inactivated toxins used in vaccines.
- **Diagnostic reagents**: Dried or buffered antigens for test kits.

### Possible substitutes

- **Attenuated organisms**: Live but weakened sources of antigens.
- **Nucleic acid templates**: DNA or RNA instructions for antigen production.
- **Crude extracts**: Less pure antigen mixtures when purification is not possible.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Denaturation**: Heat or chemicals can destroy epitope shape.
- **Low potency**: Over-dilution or poor extraction reduces immune response.
- **Cross-reactivity**: Similar molecules can cause false positives in tests.
- **Contamination**: Non-target proteins or microbes distort results.

### Risks and safety

- **Biohazards**: Source material may contain live pathogens.
- **Allergic reactions**: Antigens can trigger hypersensitivity.
- **Immune overreaction**: Strong responses can cause fever or inflammation.
