# Brief description

Plow structure describes the core parts of a plow and how they fit together to cut, lift, and turn soil. Knowing the structure helps build, repair, and adjust plows for different soils and draft power.

## Use / Function

- **Identify parts**: Beam, share, moldboard, hitch, and handles each have a specific job.
- **Set working depth**: Adjust angles and hitch height to control penetration.
- **Improve field results**: Match the structure to soil type and moisture.
- **Maintain and repair**: Replace worn edges and tighten bindings.
- **Scale**: Small household plots to community fields.

## Operating principle

- **Beam**: Main spine that carries pulling force from the hitch to the cutting edge.
- **Share**: Wedge-like blade that slices the soil.
- **Coulter**: Vertical knife or disk that pre-cuts roots and residues.
- **Moldboard**: Curved surface that lifts and rolls the soil slice.
- **Landside**: Flat plate that stabilizes lateral forces during the cut.
- **Handles**: Guide the plow and keep the share aligned.
- **Hitch and draft**: Transfers pulling force from people or animals into steady forward motion.

## How to create it

1. **Map the layout**: Mark where the beam, share, and handles meet.
2. **Shape the beam**: Carve a straight, stiff wooden spine.
3. **Mount the share**: Lash or fasten a stone or metal blade to the beam nose.
4. **Add the moldboard**: Fit a curved board behind the share to roll soil.
5. **Set the hitch**: Position the pull point so the plow bites instead of skimming.
6. **Field test**: Pull a short line and adjust angle until the soil turns cleanly.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Stone or wood versions are basic; metal shares and fittings increase efficiency.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** beam and handles, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** share, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** bindings.
- **Tools**: **[Stone tools](/en/inventions/stone-tools)** for shaping, simple cutting and drilling tools.
- **Optional durability**: **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)** fittings or replaceable tips.

## Variants and improvements

- **Scratch plow (ard)**: Light wooden design for shallow tillage.
- **Moldboard plow**: Full soil inversion for weed burial.
- **Replaceable share**: Swappable metal edge to reduce downtime.
- **Depth wheel**: Consistent depth on uneven ground.

## Limits and risks

- **Misalignment**: Poor angles cause skipping or deep gouging.
- **Wear**: Shares dull quickly in rocky soils.
- **Over-tillage**: Too much turning increases erosion risk.
- **Strain**: High draft loads can injure people or animals.
