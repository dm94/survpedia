# Brief description

Protective equipment is barrier gear used to reduce exposure to hazards such as infectious agents, heat, chemicals, or physical injury.

## Use / Function

- **Disease Control**: Limits spread of infection (masks, gowns).
- **Physical Protection**: Protects against burns, cuts, and impacts (gloves, aprons).
- **Eye/Face Protection**: Shields from UV radiation, sparks, and splashes (welding masks, goggles).
- **Source control**: Limits spread from infected people.
- **Caregiver protection**: Reduces exposure when providing care or cleaning.
- **Zone separation**: Differentiates clean and contaminated areas.
- **Surface handling**: Lowers contamination when touching waste or laundry.
- **Scale**: Individual to facility-wide.

## Operating principle

- **Physical barrier**: Blocks droplets and splashes.
- **Filtration**: Multiple layers capture particles.
- **Sealing**: Ties and elastic reduce leaks around edges.
- **Dedicated use**: Clean and dirty gear kept separate.
- **Decontamination**: Washing or disinfection restores safe reuse.

## How to create it

1. **Define risk zones**: Match gear to tasks (caregiving, cleaning, waste).
2. **Build base layers**: Use **[Clothing](/en/inventions/clothing)** as the base barrier.
3. **Cut panels**: Shape **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)** or **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)** with **[Scissors](/en/inventions/scissors)**.
4. **Sew and seal**: Stitch with **[Needle](/en/inventions/needle)** and add ties or bands from **[Natural Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)**.
5. **Add filters**: Use **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)** layers for masks or wraps.
6. **Eye protection**: Use **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** plates or shields when splashes are likely.
7. **Set cleaning rules**: Wash with **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)** and disinfect with **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Sewing and hygiene routines are the core requirements.

## Materials needed

- **Barrier layers**: **[Fabric](/en/materials/fabric)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**, **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**.
- **Seals and ties**: **[Natural Rubber](/en/materials/natural-rubber)**, cloth strips, cord.
- **Eye shields**: **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** when available.
- **Cleaning**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Medical/Epidemic Gear**:
  - **Layered masks**: Cotton inner layers with tighter outer fabric.
  - **Reusable gowns**: Washable overshirts to protect base clothing.
  - **Face shields**: Rigid glass or clear plates mounted on cloth bands.
- **Welding/Industrial Gear**:
  - **Welding Mask**: Essential for arc welding to prevent "Arc Eye" (UV burn). Requires dark glass (shade 10-14).
  - **Leather Gloves**: Heavy-duty gloves to protect against heat and sparks.
  - **Apron**: Leather or heavy canvas to protect clothing from fire/sparks.
- **Rotation sets**: Multiple kits to allow full drying between uses.

## Limits and risks

- **False confidence**: Protective gear without isolation and hygiene fails.
- **Poor fit**: Gaps around the face reduce protection.
- **Cross-contamination**: Touching the front of used gear spreads pathogens.
- **Moisture buildup**: Wet masks lose filtration performance.
- **Skin irritation**: Long wear causes rubbing and rash.
