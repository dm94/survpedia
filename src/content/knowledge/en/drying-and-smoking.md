# Brief description

Drying and smoking are low-tech preservation methods that reduce moisture and add protective compounds from smoke. They stabilize meat, fish, herbs, fruits, and vegetables for storage when refrigeration is unavailable.

## Use / Function

- **Long-term storage**: Extends shelf life without electricity.
- **Transport**: Lowers weight and bulk by removing water.
- **Safety**: Lowers water activity and suppresses microbes.
- **Flavor**: Smoke adds aroma and complexity.
- **Seasonal resilience**: Turns short harvests into long reserves.
- **Plant preservation**: Keeps fruits and vegetables stable for snacks, stews, or soups.

## Operating principle

- **Moisture removal**: **[Evaporation](/en/knowledge/evaporation)** lowers water activity to slow spoilage.
- **Airflow and heat**: Moving air and gentle heat speed surface drying without cooking.
- **Smoke chemistry**: Phenols and aldehydes from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** inhibit microbes and oxidation.
- **Salt assistance**: **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** pre-curing draws out moisture and improves texture.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare food**: Use fresh meat or fish and trim damaged parts.
2. **Optional salt cure**: Rub with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** or soak in a light brine.
3. **Arrange airflow**: Hang strips or place on racks with space between pieces.
4. **Set gentle heat**: Use a small **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** or sun-warmed air to keep it below cooking heat.
5. **Add smoke (optional)**: Burn **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for steady, cool smoke.
6. **Finish and store**: When dry and firm, move to clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.

### Drying meat and fish

1. **Trim and portion**: Remove fat, skin, and bruised areas; slice into even strips to dry uniformly.
2. **Salt or brine**: Rub with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** or soak in light **[Water](/en/materials/water)** brine, then drain and pat dry.
3. **Airflow and spacing**: Hang strips or lay on racks with gaps; use screens from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** to keep insects off.
4. **Gentle heat or smoke**: Use low heat from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**; add cool smoke with **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** if humidity is high.
5. **Dryness check and store**: Meat should be firm and dry on the surface; fish should feel leathery and not cold or wet inside. Store in clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** or seal under **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**.

### Drying fruits and vegetables

1. **Wash and trim**: Remove damaged parts and slice evenly for consistent drying.
2. **Pre-treat (optional)**: Dip fruit in **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** water or **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** water. Blanch vegetables briefly in hot **[Water](/en/materials/water)** warmed over **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, then cool.
3. **Arrange airflow**: Lay slices on racks or screens woven from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** with space between pieces. Cover with mesh to keep insects off.
4. **Dry gently**: Use sun, shade, or low heat until fruit feels leathery and vegetables snap when bent.
5. **Condition and store**: Cool fully, pack into **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, and re-dry if moisture appears.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: Food to preserve, airflow, clean handling surface.
- **Fuel options**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for controlled heat or smoke.
- **Tools**: Knife, racks or cords, mesh or screens from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**, cover to keep insects off.
- **Possible substitutes**: **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** curing, **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** for acidic preservation, or sealing under **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** after drying.

## Variants and improvements

- **Sun drying**: Best in dry climates with strong airflow.
- **Shade drying**: Reduces oxidation and heat damage.
- **Cold smoking**: Smoke flavor with minimal heat after drying.
- **Hot smoking**: Adds heat to partially cook and dry at the same time.
- **Smokehouse or pit**: More stable airflow and temperature control.
- **Modern**: Dehydrators and filtered smoke systems.

### Cold smoking

- **Goal**: Adds aroma and a mild protective layer without cooking.
- **Preparation**: Use **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** curing and partial drying to lower moisture.
- **Clean smoke**: Generate gentle smoke from **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**, avoiding resins and direct flame.
- **Heat separation**: Keep the **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** source away so food receives cool smoke only.
- **Airflow**: Ventilate to prevent condensation and bitter flavors.
- **Finish**: Cool, air out, and store in clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**; if moisture remains, continue drying.

## Limits and risks

- **Underdrying**: Moist cores can allow dangerous pathogens.
- **High humidity**: Slows drying and encourages mold.
- **Overheating**: Cooks the surface and traps moisture inside.
- **Contamination**: Dirty racks or insects spoil batches.
- **Creosote**: Harsh smoke can make food bitter or unsafe.
- **Fire hazard**: Open flames can ignite racks or shelters.
