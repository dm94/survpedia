# Brief description

Bread baking is the controlled process of mixing flour with water, resting or fermenting the dough, shaping it, and applying heat to set its structure. It turns raw grain into stable, portable calories and enables community-scale food production.

## Use / Function

- **Staple food:** Dense, reliable energy from grains.
- **Preservation:** Baking reduces moisture and slows spoilage.
- **Portability:** Loaves and flatbreads are easy to carry and portion.
- **Community efficiency:** Shared ovens optimize fuel use.

## Operating principle

- **Hydration and kneading:** Water hydrates flour to form gluten, creating an elastic network.
- **Gas expansion:** **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)** or steam inflates the dough.
- **Heat setting:** Starch gelatinizes and proteins coagulate, forming crust and crumb.
- **Heat management:** An enclosed hot space evens heat and controls moisture.

## How to create it

1. **Make flour:** Grind **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** (or other grains) with a **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)** or **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**.
2. **Mix dough:** Combine flour, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, and **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**. Add **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or a sourdough starter for leavened bread.
3. **Develop structure:** Knead until elastic, then rest to relax and ferment.
4. **Shape and proof:** Form loaves or flatbreads and allow a final rise if leavened.
5. **Bake:** Preheat a **[Kiln / Oven](/en/inventions/kiln)** or a hot stone near **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** and bake until the crust sets and the interior is cooked.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Flour from grain, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**.
- **Leavening:** **[Yeast](/en/materials/yeast)** or wild starter.
- **Heat:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** and **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**.
- **Tools:** **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for mixing, grinding tools, and a **[Kiln / Oven](/en/inventions/kiln)** or hot stone surface.

## Variants and improvements

- **Flatbread:** Fast and fuel-efficient, no fermentation required.
- **Sourdough:** Longer fermentation improves flavor and shelf life.
- **Enriched dough:** Added fats or sugars for softness.
- **Hardtack:** Very low moisture for long storage.
- **Steam baking:** Moist heat creates a thicker crust and better rise.

## Limits and risks

- **Undercooking:** Dense centers can spoil quickly.
- **Fuel demand:** Baking requires sustained heat and dry fuel.
- **Smoke and ash:** Open-fire baking can contaminate flavor and surface.
- **Mold and staling:** Poor storage leads to spoilage or hardening.
- **Dietary limits:** Gluten intolerance restricts wheat-based breads.
