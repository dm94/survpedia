# Brief description

Vaccination is the controlled delivery of antigens to train immune memory and reduce the spread and severity of infectious disease. It complements hygiene, isolation, and sanitation during outbreaks.

## Use / Function

- **Lower susceptibility**: Reduces the chance of infection or severe disease.
- **Community protection**: Protects vulnerable groups by reducing transmission chains.
- **Caregiver safety**: Lowers risk for people providing care.
- **Outbreak control**: Helps stop growth when combined with isolation and hygiene.
- **Scale**: Individual, community clinics, or mass campaigns.

## Operating principle

- **Antigen exposure**: Safe antigens stimulate immune recognition.
- **Memory formation**: The body stores a faster response for future exposure.
- **Timing**: Doses and boosters shape the strength and duration of protection.
- **Coverage**: Higher uptake reduces circulation of the pathogen.

## How to create it

1. **Plan priorities**: Define target groups and contraindications based on risk.
2. **Secure supply**: Verify vaccine type, storage needs, and expiry.
3. **Set cold storage**: Use shaded storage or a **[Zeer Pot](/en/inventions/zeer-pot)** when electricity is unavailable.
4. **Prepare a clean area**: Organize flow, hand hygiene, and safe disposal.
5. **Deliver doses**: Trained staff administer with clean technique and **[Needles](/en/inventions/needle)**.
6. **Observe and support**: Monitor for immediate reactions and provide guidance.
7. **Record and follow up**: Track doses and schedule boosters.

### Required technological level

Intermediate. Reliable supply, safe handling, and trained staff are essential.

## Materials needed

- **Hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
- **Delivery**: **[Needles](/en/inventions/needle)** and clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for supplies and disposal.
- **Storage**: **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** vials and cool storage such as a **[Zeer Pot](/en/inventions/zeer-pot)**.
- **Tool materials**: **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for durable instruments.

## Variants and improvements

- **Ring vaccination**: Target contacts around confirmed cases.
- **Mass campaigns**: Rapid coverage for high transmission areas.
- **Booster schedules**: Extend or strengthen protection.
- **Mobile teams**: Reach remote populations.

## Limits and risks

- **Cold chain failure**: Heat can reduce vaccine effectiveness.
- **Supply gaps**: Interrupted delivery lowers coverage.
- **Hesitancy**: Misinformation or fear reduces uptake.
- **Adverse reactions**: Rare but possible; requires preparedness.
- **Counterfeit doses**: Unsafe or ineffective products harm trust.
