# Brief description

Evaporation is the phase change where liquid water becomes vapor, removing moisture from surfaces and solutions. It is a core process behind **[Salt & Preservation](/en/knowledge/salt-and-preservation)** because it concentrates brine and dries food to slow spoilage.

## Use / Function

- **Brine concentration**: Turns seawater or brine into crystallized salt.
- **Sugar concentration**: Reduces plant juice to crystallize **[Sugar](/en/materials/sugar)**.
- **Food drying**: Lowers water activity to preserve meat, fish, and plants.
- **Surface cooling**: Provides passive cooling when water evaporates.
- **Moisture control**: Reduces dampness in storage and materials.

## Operating principle

- **Energy absorption**: Water molecules take heat to escape into the air.
- **Airflow and humidity**: Dry, moving air speeds evaporation; humid air slows it.
- **Surface area**: Thin layers and wide pans evaporate faster.
- **Salinity effect**: Salt lowers vapor pressure, so brine evaporates slightly slower than fresh water.

## How to create it

1. **Expose a thin layer**: Spread brine or food on shallow trays or racks.
2. **Promote airflow**: Place in breezy shade or use **[Controlled Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for gentle warmth.
3. **Protect from contamination**: Cover with cloth or mesh to keep insects and dust out.
4. **Monitor dryness**: Check texture and weight; stop when the surface is dry and stable.
5. **Finish and store**: Move to clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** and keep sealed.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** or food to dry, shallow **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **Tools**: Drying racks, cloth/mesh covers, low heat source (sun or **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**).
- **Possible substitutes**: Porous **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** pots for slow evaporation; wind exposure instead of heat.

## Variants and improvements

- **Solar pans**: Wide shallow ponds for large-scale salt making.
- **Shade drying**: Reduces oxidation and insect pressure for herbs and fish.
- **Low-smoke drying**: Use **[Charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** for steady heat.
- **Evaporative cooling**: Wet cloth or porous pots to cool storage.

## Limits and risks

- **High humidity**: Greatly slows evaporation.
- **Contamination**: Dust, insects, or animals can spoil food.
- **Overheating**: Too much heat can cook or harden food surfaces.
- **Uneven drying**: Thick pieces trap moisture and can rot inside.
