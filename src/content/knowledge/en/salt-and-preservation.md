# Brief description

Salt preservation is a set of techniques that use salt, brine, or salt-assisted drying to keep food safe and stable for long periods. It is a foundational method for securing calories, especially when harvests or hunting are seasonal.

## Use / Function

- **Long-term storage**: Keeps meat, fish, and vegetables usable for months.
- **Safety**: Limits the growth of spoilage microbes.
- **Transport**: Makes food lighter and more portable after drying.
- **Flavor and texture**: Concentrates flavors and creates firm textures.
- **Community resilience**: Supports stockpiles for winter or drought.

## Operating principle

- **Osmosis and dehydration**: **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** draws water out of food and microbes, lowering water activity.
- **Brine control**: Salt dissolved in **[Water](/en/materials/water)** creates a stable salty environment that inhibits bacteria.
- **Secondary barriers**: Drying, smoke from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, or acidity from **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** add extra protection.
- **Exclusion**: Covering with **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)** can reduce oxygen exposure.

## How to create it

1. **Select food**: Use fresh meat, fish, or vegetables and trim damaged parts.
2. **Choose method**:
   - **Dry cure**: Rub with salt (2–5% by weight) and rest until liquid draws out.
   - **Brine**: Dissolve salt in clean water (5–10% by weight) and fully submerge.
3. **Pack and weigh**: Use a clean **[Container](/en/inventions/containers)** and a weight to keep food under brine.
4. **Hold time**: Keep in a cool, shaded place until the texture firms.
5. **Finish**: Air-dry, smoke, or store in sealed containers for longer life.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**, fresh food, clean **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, and clean **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **Tools**: Knife, scale or measuring cups, weights, drying rack.
- **Possible substitutes**: Drying or smoking with **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, fermentation, or acid preservation with **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Dry curing**: Salt only, sometimes with herbs or spices.
- **Wet brining**: Salt dissolved in water for even penetration.
- **Pickling**: Salt plus acid from **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)**.
- **Fermentation**: Salted vegetables preserved by **[Fermentation](/en/inventions/fermentation)**.
- **Confit**: Slow cooking and storage under **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**.
- **Modern**: Refrigeration, vacuum sealing, and pasteurization.

## Limits and risks

- **Undersalting**: Can enable dangerous pathogens (botulism risk).
- **Over-salting**: Makes food too salty and dehydrating to eat.
- **Contamination**: Dirty tools or containers spoil batches.
- **Moisture reentry**: Poor sealing leads to mold or slime.
- **Corrosion**: Salt accelerates rusting of metal tools.
