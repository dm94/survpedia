# Brief description

Mining is the controlled extraction of minerals, stone, and fuels from the ground. It ranges from surface gathering and quarrying to shafts and tunnels, and it feeds metallurgy, construction, and energy systems.

## Use / Function

- **Metals**: Supplies ores for **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)**, and alloys.
- **Fuel**: Provides **[Coal](/en/materials/coal)** for heat and industry.
- **Construction**: Delivers **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)**, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, and **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)**.
- **Materials processing**: Enables smelting, ceramics, and durable tools.
- **Trade**: Concentrates valuable resources for exchange.
- **Scale**: From hand collection to organized shafts and quarries.

## Operating principle

- **Prospecting**: Identify seams or outcrops by color, density, and surface clues.
- **Fracture**: Use impact and leverage to break host rock.
- **Separation**: Sort by size and density; wash with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** to concentrate ore.
- **Support and access**: Stabilize openings with **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** and **[Reinforcements](/en/inventions/reinforcements)**, and plan routes.
- **Hauling**: Move rock using **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**, **[Carts](/en/inventions/cart)**, and **[Pulleys](/en/inventions/pulley)**.

## How to create it

1. **Survey**: Follow streams, slopes, and exposed rock for ore signs.
2. **Choose method**: Start with surface pits or trenches before shafts.
3. **Open access**: Remove overburden, cut steps, and add **[Reinforcements](/en/inventions/reinforcements)** if walls crumble.
4. **Extract**: Break rock with a **[Pickaxe](/en/inventions/pickaxe)** and **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)**, then sort.
5. **Haul**: Use **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**, **[Pulleys](/en/inventions/pulley)**, and **[Carts](/en/inventions/cart)** to move material.
6. **Concentrate**: Wash ore and keep only the high-value fraction.

### Required technological level

Basic for surface collection and panning. Intermediate for shallow pits and timbered drifts. Advanced for deep shafts with ventilation and drainage.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)** tools, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for supports, **[Reinforcements](/en/inventions/reinforcements)**, **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** for hauling.
- **Processing**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)** for washing, **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)** or **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** for molds when smelting.
- **Tools**: **[Pickaxe](/en/inventions/pickaxe)**, **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)**, **[Cart](/en/inventions/cart)**, **[Pulley](/en/inventions/pulley)**, **[Controlled Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for light and heat.
- **Substitutes**: Stone hammers, woven baskets, sleds, or drags.

## Variants and improvements

- **Placer mining**: Panning or sluicing in rivers for heavy minerals.
- **Open pit and quarry**: Wide surface cuts for stone and ore.
- **Adits and drifts**: Horizontal tunnels following a seam.
- **Shaft mining**: Vertical access to deeper deposits.
- **Mechanical lifting**: **[Wheel](/en/inventions/wheel)** and **[Axle](/en/inventions/axle)** systems with pulleys.

## Limits and risks

- **Collapse**: Unstable roofs and walls can fail.
- **Air quality**: Dust and gases accumulate in enclosed spaces.
- **Toxic gases**: Methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide can build up; test airflow and vent continuously.
- **Flooding**: Water can fill shafts and pits quickly.
- **Exhaustion**: Heavy labor and heat stress reduce safety.
- **Environmental damage**: Erosion and habitat loss without reclamation.
