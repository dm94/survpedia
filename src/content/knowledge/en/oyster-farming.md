# Brief description

Oyster farming is the cultivation of oysters in coastal or estuarine waters using structures that keep them in optimal flow for feeding and growth.

## Use / Function

- **Food supply**: Provides protein and minerals with minimal land use.
- **Trade**: Creates a durable coastal product for exchange.
- **Resilience**: Adds a reliable harvest that does not require daily feeding.
- **Scale**: From small intertidal racks to floating raft systems.

## Operating principle

- **Filter feeding**: Oysters feed by filtering plankton from moving water.
- **Suspension**: Racks, bags, or lines keep shells above silt and predators.
- **Tidal exchange**: Regular flow brings oxygen and food and removes waste.
- **Settlement**: Oyster spat attach to collectors or are placed in bags.

## How to create it

1. **Choose a site**: Brackish to salty water, steady flow, low pollution, and shelter from heavy waves.
2. **Secure seed**: Collect spat on clean shells or obtain juvenile oysters.
3. **Build supports**: Use **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** stakes, **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**, and mesh bags or **[Fishing Nets](/en/inventions/fishing-net)**.
4. **Stock and space**: Spread seed to avoid crowding and ensure water flow.
5. **Maintain**: Clean fouling organisms, flip bags, and repair lines.
6. **Protect**: Use netting and elevation to reduce crab and starfish predation.
7. **Harvest and purge**: Grade by size, then hold in clean water before eating.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**, **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)**, **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**, **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** for weights.
- **Tools**: **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**, **[Fishing Net](/en/inventions/fishing-net)**, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, **[Raft](/en/inventions/raft)** or **[Simple Boat](/en/inventions/simple-boat)**.
- **Substitutes**: Bamboo poles, woven baskets, or reed racks lined with netting.

## Variants and improvements

- **Bottom culture**: Oysters placed directly on suitable seabed.
- **Rack and bag**: Bags mounted on trestles in intertidal zones.
- **Longline or raft**: Suspended baskets in deeper, cleaner flow.
- **Grading**: Periodic sorting improves uniform size and survival.

## Limits and risks

- **Water quality**: Pollution or harmful algal blooms make oysters unsafe.
- **Predation**: Crabs, starfish, and birds can reduce yield.
- **Storm damage**: Waves can tear gear or bury beds with silt.
- **Salinity swings**: Heavy rain can stress or kill stock.
- **Theft and access**: Coastal sites are hard to secure.
