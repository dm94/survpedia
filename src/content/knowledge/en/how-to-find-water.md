# Brief description

A practical guide to locating, collecting, and securing water in natural environments when infrastructure is unavailable.

## Use / Function

- **Survival:** Locate drinkable or treatable water sources.
- **Exploration:** Plan routes and camps with water access.
- **Emergency:** Obtain minimum water to stay hydrated.
- **Scale:** Personal and community.

## Operating principle

Water follows **gravity** and collects in low points. It also reveals itself through **biological signs** (vegetation, animals) and can be gathered through **condensation** (dew) or filtration in porous soils.

## How to create it

1. **Read the terrain:** Look for depressions, V-shaped valleys, confluences of dry streams, and shaded slopes.
2. **Detect signs:** Greener vegetation, insects at dawn, animal tracks, and damp soil.
3. **Find surface water:** Springs, seeps at the base of rock faces, temporary pools after rain.
4. **Access subsurface water:** In dry streambeds, dig a shallow well on the inside of bends and wait for seepage.
5. **Collect dew:** Drag a cloth or plant fibers over wet grass at dawn and wring into a container.
6. **Make it safer:** Filter through layers of **[sand](/en/materials/sand)** and **[charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**, then boil when possible.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Watertight container, cordage or **[plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**, basic digging tool.
- **Filtration:** **[Sand](/en/materials/sand)**, **[charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)**, cloth or compacted fibers.
- **Substitutes:** Melted snow or ice, freshly collected rainwater.

## Variants and improvements

- **Seep well lining:** Add gravel and sand to improve clarity.
- **Rain harvesting:** Simple gutters into covered containers.
- **Safe storage:** Lidded containers to prevent recontamination of **[water](/en/materials/water)**.

## Limits and risks

- **Biological contamination:** Clear water can still carry pathogens.
- **Salinity or toxicity:** Avoid brackish, algae-heavy, or chemical-smelling water.
- **Heat exhaustion:** Digging in hot hours can worsen dehydration.
- **Wildlife:** Dangerous animals often use the same sources.
