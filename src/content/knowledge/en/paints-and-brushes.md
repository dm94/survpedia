# Brief description

Paints & Brushes is the practical knowledge of preparing color, mixing binders, and applying controlled strokes to surfaces for protection, signaling, decoration, and information.

## Use / Function

- **Surface protection**: Seal wood, plaster, or stone with **[Paint](/en/materials/paint)** to reduce weathering.
- **Communication**: Marks, symbols, maps, and warnings made with **[Ink](/en/materials/ink)** or paint.
- **Decoration and craft**: Art, ornament, and pattern work on **[Canvas](/en/materials/canvas)**, wood, or plaster.
- **Process support**: Controlled application of binders like **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)** or **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**.

## Operating principle

- **Pigment suspension**: **[Pigments](/en/materials/pigments)** are dispersed into a binder to stick to surfaces.
- **Flow control**: Water or solvent sets viscosity for stroke width and coverage.
- **Bristle action**: A **[Brush](/en/inventions/brush)** holds liquid in bristles and releases it through capillary action.
- **Surface adhesion**: Clean, slightly porous surfaces grab the binder and lock pigment.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare pigment**: Grind and wash **[Pigments](/en/materials/pigments)** until smooth and fine.
2. **Choose a binder**: Oil, glue, or gum based on surface and drying speed.
3. **Mix to consistency**: Add **[Water](/en/materials/water)** or solvent slowly until the paint flows without dripping.
4. **Build a brush**: Use **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for a handle and **[Animal Hair](/en/materials/animal-hair)** or **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for bristles.
5. **Test strokes**: Try on scrap to confirm opacity, drying, and flow.
6. **Apply and cure**: Use thin layers, allowing full drying between coats.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Good results need clean mixing and steady hand skills.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Pigments](/en/materials/pigments)**, binder (oil, **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)**, or **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**), **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Brush](/en/inventions/brush)**.
- **Tools**: Grinding stone, mixing slab, containers, **[String](/en/materials/string)** for binding bristles.
- **Surfaces**: **[Canvas](/en/materials/canvas)**, wood, plastered walls.

## Variants and improvements

- **Wall painting**: Use lime or gypsum preparation with **[Painting Walls](/en/inventions/painting-walls)**.
- **Fine work**: Softer hair for calligraphy and detail.
- **Textile application**: Thickened dye with **[Fabric Dyeing](/en/inventions/fabric-dyeing)** methods.
- **Durable coats**: Multiple thin layers with proper drying reduce cracking.

## Limits and risks

- **Peeling and cracking**: Poor surface prep or too-thick coats fail.
- **Toxic pigments and solvents**: Many colors are hazardous; avoid inhalation and skin contact.
- **Brush damage**: Dried paint ruins bristles; clean immediately.
- **Weather exposure**: Unsealed surfaces fade and chalk over time.
