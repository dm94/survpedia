# Brief description

Staple crops are high-yield plants that provide the bulk of daily calories for a population. They are chosen for reliable production, storability, and versatility in basic cooking and preservation.

## Use / Function

- **Calorie base:** Provides the main energy source for communities.
- **Food security:** Reliable harvests reduce famine risk.
- **Storage and trade:** Grains and dried roots can be stored and exchanged.
- **Scale:** Household to regional food systems.

## Operating principle

Staple crops prioritize **yield per area**, **storability**, and **simple processing**. Grains such as **[Wheat](/en/materials/wheat)** and **[Rice](/en/materials/rice)** dry well for long storage, while tubers like **[Potato](/en/materials/potato)** and **[Cassava](/en/materials/cassava)** provide dense calories even in poorer soils.

## How to create it

1. **Select climate-ready crops:** Choose species adapted to local rainfall and temperature.
2. **Prepare soil:** Clear, loosen, and add organic matter.
3. **Plant and protect:** Sow seeds or plant cuttings at proper spacing; manage weeds.
4. **Harvest and dry:** Harvest at maturity, then dry or cure to prevent spoilage.
5. **Store safely:** Use dry, sealed containers and elevated storage.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Seeds or cuttings, water, fertile soil.
- **Tools:** Digging stick or hoe, **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)** or **[Hand Mill](/en/inventions/hand-mill)**, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** for cooking.
- **Substitutes:** Mix grains and tubers to spread climate and pest risk.

## Variants and improvements

- **Crop rotation:** Alternating crops to restore soil and reduce pests.
- **Irrigated fields:** Higher yields where water is controlled.
- **Storage upgrades:** Granaries, sealed pottery, and drying racks.
- **Selection:** Saving the best seed improves yield and resilience over time.

## Limits and risks

- **Monoculture vulnerability:** Single-crop reliance increases disease and pest losses.
- **Soil exhaustion:** Repeated planting without replenishment depletes nutrients.
- **Post-harvest spoilage:** Moisture leads to mold and rot.
- **Diet gaps:** Heavy reliance on one staple can cause nutrient deficiencies.
