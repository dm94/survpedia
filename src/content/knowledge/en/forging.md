# Forging (Blacksmithing)

Forging is the manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (the most common for blacksmithing).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Heating
Metal must be heated to a specific temperature to become plastic (malleable) without melting.
- **Red Heat (600-800°C)**: Good for finishing and smoothing.
- **Orange Heat (900-1000°C)**: General shaping, bending, and drawing.
- **Yellow/White Heat (1100-1200°C)**: Welding heat. The metal is near melting and surfaces are sticky.

### 2. The Color of Heat
Blacksmiths judge temperature by the glowing color of the metal.
- **Dull Red**: ~600°C
- **Cherry Red**: ~750°C (Critical temperature for hardening steel)
- **Orange**: ~900°C
- **Yellow**: ~1100°C
- **White**: ~1300°C (Sparking/Burning risk)

## Fundamental Techniques

There are five basic operations in forging:

1.  **Drawing Out**: Lengthening the metal by reducing its thickness. (Hammering it while moving it across the anvil).
2.  **Upsetting**: Thickening the metal by shortening its length. (Heating the end and hammering it back into itself).
3.  **Bending**: Creating curves or angles. (Hammering over the horn or edge of the anvil).
4.  **Punching**: Making holes. (Driving a punch through the hot metal over the pritchel or hardie hole).
5.  **Forge Welding**: Joining two pieces of metal by heating them to near melting and hammering them together until they fuse.

## Heat Treatment

Controlling the crystal structure of the metal (especially steel) through heating and cooling.

- **Annealing**: Heating the metal and allowing it to cool very slowly (often buried in ash). This softens the metal, making it easy to file, drill, or shape cold, and relieves internal stresses.
- **Hardening (Quenching)**: Heating high-carbon steel to its critical temperature (cherry red) and cooling it rapidly in water or oil. This makes the steel extremely hard but brittle (like glass).
- **Tempering**: Re-heating hardened steel to a lower temperature (straw, purple, or blue color) to trade some hardness for toughness. This prevents tools from shattering under impact.

## Safety and Risks

- **Burns**: The most obvious risk. Metal can look black but still be hot enough to burn.
- **Eye Injury**: Hot scale (flakes of oxide) flies off when hammering. Safety glasses are mandatory.
- **Fumes**: Burning coal produces sulfur and carbon monoxide. Good ventilation is critical.
- **Fire**: The forge is an open fire; sparks can ignite the workshop.

## Required Setup

To start forging, you need the "Smithy's Triangle":
1.  **Source of Heat**: The **[Forge](/en/inventions/forge)**.
2.  **Something to hit with**: The **[Hammer](/en/inventions/hammer)**.
3.  **Something to hit on**: The **[Anvil](/en/inventions/anvil)**.
