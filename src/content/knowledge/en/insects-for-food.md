# Brief description

Insects for food is the practice of harvesting, preparing, and eating edible insects as a compact source of protein, fats, and micronutrients with low resource requirements.

## Use / Function

- **Nutrition:** Provides protein, fats, iron, and B vitamins.
- **Resilience:** Insects are often available when large game is scarce.
- **Preservation:** Dried insects store well and travel easily.
- **Scale:** From hand foraging to small household rearing.

## Operating principle

- **Selection:** Identify edible species and avoid toxic or protected ones.
- **Safety:** Heat kills most parasites and pathogens.
- **Moisture control:** Drying reduces spoilage and insect fats stabilize.
- **Containment:** **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** protect the harvest from pests and moisture.

## How to create it

1. **Identify safe species:** Use local knowledge and avoid pesticide-treated areas.
2. **Harvest:** Hand-pick, shake branches onto cloth, or use **[Traps](/en/inventions/traps)** and simple **[Fly catcher](/en/inventions/fly-catcher)** setups.
3. **Clean:** Rinse with **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, remove wings or hard legs if needed, and discard damaged insects.
4. **Cook:** Roast or boil using **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, or pan-fry with **[Vegetable Oil](/en/materials/vegetable-oil)**.
5. **Preserve:** Salt lightly with **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** and dry on warm stones or racks over low heat.
6. **Store:** Keep dried insects in dry **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Edible insects, **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)**.
- **Tools:** **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**, heat from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**, mesh or **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** for collection.
- **Substitutes:** Ash or smoke drying when fuel is scarce, bark trays instead of pots, woven baskets lined with leaves.

## Variants and improvements

- **Roasted whole:** Fast and low equipment.
- **Boiled or fried:** Better texture and safety with oil.
- **Insect flour:** Dry and grind into powder for breads and stews.
- **Household rearing:** Use simple boxes, feed with plant scraps, and keep dry bedding from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)**.

## Limits and risks

- **Allergies:** Chitin can trigger reactions, especially for people allergic to shellfish.
- **Toxins:** Misidentification or pesticide exposure can be dangerous.
- **Spoilage:** High moisture causes rancidity and mold.
- **Overharvesting:** Local populations can be depleted if collection is too intense.
