# Brief description

Basic hygiene is the set of essential practices and knowledge to preserve health and prevent disease through cleanliness of the body, food, and environment. It is not a single object, but a system of habits and tools fundamental for survival.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to reduce the burden of pathogens and parasites:

- **Disease prevention**: Reduces gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory infections.
- **Body maintenance**: Prevents dental cavities, wound infections, and skin problems.
- **Psychological well-being**: Improves morale and comfort in survival situations.
- **Scale**: Personal and community.

## Operating principle

It is based on the mechanical and chemical removal of dirt and microorganisms:

- **Mechanical**: Friction (rubbing, brushing) dislodges dirt and bacterial biofilms.
- **Chemical**: Soap or ash breaks down lipid membranes of viruses and bacteria, and emulsifies fats so water can wash them away.
- **Isolation**: Waste management (latrines) separates pathogens from water and food sources.

## How to create it

More than manufacturing, it is about establishing routines and making the necessary tools:

1.  **Hand washing**: Critical after defecating and before eating. Use water and soap (or ash/sand if soap is unavailable).
2.  **Dental hygiene**: Daily brushing with a chewing stick or [toothbrush](/en/inventions/toothbrush) and mild abrasive (charcoal, chalk).
3.  **Body bathing**: Regular cleaning, paying attention to folds and wounds.
4.  **Waste management**: Use of [latrines](/en/inventions/latrine) away from water sources.

### Required technological level

Basic. Does not require advanced technology, only knowledge and discipline.

## Materials needed

- **Water**: The universal solvent for cleaning.
- **Soap**: For chemical cleaning (or substitutes like soapwort).
- **Mild abrasives**: White ash, fine sand, clay, salt.
- **Tools**: [Toothbrush](/en/inventions/toothbrush), [comb](/en/inventions/comb), containers.

## Variants and improvements

- **Primitive**: Use of sand, ash, and river water; chewing sticks for teeth.
- **Advanced**: Scented soaps, fluoride toothpaste (if available), hot water showers, sewage systems.

## Limits and risks

- **False security**: Washing with contaminated water can be worse than not washing. Water must be safe or boiled.
- **Irritation**: Excessive use of strong abrasives (like pure ash or coarse sand) can damage skin and dental enamel.
- **Cross-contamination**: Sharing hygiene tools (brushes, towels) can spread diseases.
