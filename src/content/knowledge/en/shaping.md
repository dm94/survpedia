# Shaping

Shaping (or manufacturing/forming) is the general process of altering the form of a raw material to create a useful object. It encompasses various techniques depending on the material and the desired outcome, ranging from removing excess material to deforming it under pressure.

## Main Categories of Shaping

### 1. Deformation (Forming)

Changing the shape of a solid body without removing material. This preserves the mass of the original piece.

- **[Forging](/en/knowledge/forging)**: Using compressive forces (hammering) on hot or cold **[Metal](/en/materials/metal)**.
- **Bending**: Angling the material along a straight axis.
- **Rolling**: Passing metal through rollers to flatten it into sheets or bars.
- **Extrusion**: Pushing material through a die to create objects with a fixed cross-sectional profile (like pipes or wire).

### 2. Material Removal (Subtractive)

Removing excess material from a larger block to achieve the desired shape.

- **Cutting**: Separating material using a **[Knife](/en/inventions/knife)**, **[Saw](/en/inventions/saw)**, or **[Chisel](/en/inventions/chisel)**.
- **Machining**: Using complex tools to cut material with precision, such as a **[Lathe](/en/inventions/manual-lathe)** (for turning) or **[Drill](/en/inventions/hand-drill)** (for holes).
- **Abrasion**: Grinding or sanding surfaces with **[Sandpaper](/en/materials/sandpaper)** or a **[File](/en/inventions/file)** to smooth or shape them.

### 3. Molding and Casting (Solidification)

Pouring liquid or pliable material into a mold where it solidifies into the shape of the cavity.

- **Casting**: Used for metals like **[Bronze](/en/materials/bronze)** or **[Iron](/en/materials/iron)**, and for **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**.
- **Molding**: Shaping pliable materials like **[Clay](/en/materials/clay)** (often on a **[Potter's Wheel](/en/inventions/potters-wheel)**) before firing.

### 4. Joining (Additive)

Assembling separate parts together to form a larger or more complex shape.

- **Welding**: Fusing metals by melting the workpieces.
- **Fastening**: Using mechanical means like **[Nails](/en/inventions/mechanical-joints)**, **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**, or **[Wire](/en/inventions/wire)**.
- **Bonding**: Using **[Glue](/en/materials/glue)** or adhesives.

## Relation to Forging

**[Forging](/en/knowledge/forging)** is a specific subset of shaping that relies on _plastic deformation_.

- **vs. Machining**: Forging rearranges the metal's grain structure rather than cutting through it, resulting in stronger parts. Machining is often used _after_ forging to achieve final dimensions.
- **vs. Casting**: Forged parts are generally tougher and less porous than cast parts, though casting can produce more complex shapes in a single step.

## Importance

Shaping is fundamental to all technology. The ability to shape **[Stone](/en/materials/stone)** defined the Paleolithic era, while the ability to shape metal defined the Bronze and Iron Ages. Choosing the right shaping process depends on the material's properties, the required precision, and the intended use of the object.
