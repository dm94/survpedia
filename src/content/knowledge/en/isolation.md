# Brief description

Isolation is the temporary separation of people with confirmed or suspected infection to cut transmission. It works with hygiene, sanitation, and communication to protect the community and keep basic services running.

## Use / Function

- **Transmission cutoff**: Reduces close contacts and secondary outbreaks.
- **Protection of vulnerable people**: Lowers exposure for high-risk groups.
- **Care organization**: Helps assign resources and staff safely.
- **Community management**: Sets clear movement and support rules.
- **Scale**: Household, neighborhood, or community spaces.

## Operating principle

- **Physical separation**: Keeps barriers between cases and non-cases.
- **Transmission window**: Limits the time a person can infect others.
- **Dose reduction**: Lower exposure reduces infectious load.
- **Controlled flows**: One-way entry and exit prevent unnecessary crossings.
- **Ventilation**: Fresh air reduces particle concentration.

## How to create it

1. **Identify cases**: Use simple symptom and contact criteria for early isolation.
2. **Design zones**: Create clean, transition, and isolation areas with one-way circulation.
3. **Control air**: Prioritize **[Passive Ventilation](/en/inventions/passive-ventilation)** in isolation areas.
4. **Strict hygiene**: Wash with **[Water](/en/materials/water)** and **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, or **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)** when water is limited.
5. **Waste management**: Use **[Latrines](/en/inventions/latrine)** and closed **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for clothing and waste.
6. **Basic support**: Ensure water, food, communication, and daily records.
7. **Safe exit**: Set criteria for ending isolation and do final cleaning.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Organization, discipline, and hygiene resources matter most.

## Materials needed

- **Hygiene**: **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, **[Soap](/en/materials/soap)**, **[Alcohol](/en/materials/alcohol)**, **[Cotton](/en/materials/cotton)**.
- **Cleaning**: **[Vinegar](/en/materials/vinegar)** and **[Lime](/en/materials/lime)** for basic disinfection.
- **Sanitation**: **[Latrines](/en/inventions/latrine)** and closed **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)**.
- **Air**: **[Passive Ventilation](/en/inventions/passive-ventilation)** for air renewal.

## Variants and improvements

- **Household isolation**: Separation inside the home with defined routes and utensils.
- **Community isolation**: Dedicated spaces with logistical support.
- **Cohorting**: Grouping similar cases to reduce cross exposure.
- **Care shifts**: Rotation to avoid continuous exposure.

## Limits and risks

- **Stigma and refusal**: Can reduce cooperation without clear communication.
- **Household spread**: Isolation fails without barriers.
- **Emotional strain**: Prolonged separation affects mental health.
- **Noncompliance**: Lack of basic support breaks adherence.
- **Poor ventilation**: Increases risk inside isolation areas.
