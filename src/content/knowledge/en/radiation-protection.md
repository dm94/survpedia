# Brief description

Radiation protection is the set of barriers, practices, and controls that reduce exposure to ionizing radiation during generation, use, and maintenance.

## Use / Function

- **Dose reduction:** Minimizes radiation received by people and equipment.
- **Operational safety:** Enables safe use of X-rays.
- **Public protection:** Limits exposure outside the work area.
- **Environment control:** Defines safe and restricted zones.
- **Scale:** From portable units to shielded rooms.

## Operating principle

- **Time, distance, shielding:** Less time, more distance, dense barriers reduce dose.
- **Attenuation:** Dense materials absorb and scatter high-energy photons.
- **Collimation:** A tighter beam reduces scatter.
- **Containment:** Housings and barriers block unwanted emission.
- **Monitoring:** Periodic measurements verify shielding performance.

## How to create it

1. **Characterize the source:** Type, energy, and usage frequency.
2. **Define zones:** Controlled areas, transitions, and access limits.
3. **Design shielding:** Use **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, and **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for the expected dose.
4. **Control the beam:** Integrate collimation and housings into the **[X-ray apparatus](/en/inventions/x-ray-apparatus)**.
5. **Set routines:** Time limits, working distance, and checks.
6. **Validate with measurements:** Identify leaks and adjust barriers.

### Required technological level

Intermediate to advanced. Basic dose planning, dense materials, and area control are required.

## Materials needed

- **Primary shielding:** **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)**, **[Concrete](/en/materials/concrete)**, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)**.
- **Viewing windows:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)** with lead layers when needed.
- **Additional attenuation:** **[Water](/en/materials/water)** in tanks or walls.
- **Reference equipment:** **[X-ray apparatus](/en/inventions/x-ray-apparatus)** and **[X-ray tube](/en/inventions/x-ray-tube)**.

## Variants and improvements

- **Fixed rooms:** Shielded suites for heavy use.
- **Mobile barriers:** Lead panels for temporary protection.
- **Layered shielding:** Lead with concrete for higher energy.
- **Remote operation:** Distance-based exposure reduction.

## Limits and risks

- **False security:** Poor installation creates critical leaks.
- **Lead toxicity:** Handling and waste must be controlled.
- **Shielding degradation:** Impacts and vibration create weak points.
- **Cumulative exposure:** Repeated small doses still add risk.
