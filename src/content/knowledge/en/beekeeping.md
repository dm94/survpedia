# Brief description

Beekeeping is the managed care of honey bee colonies to harvest honey and wax while keeping the hive healthy and productive.

## Use / Function

- **Food**: Harvests **[Honey](/en/materials/honey)** as a stable energy source.
- **Materials**: Produces **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** for **[Candles](/en/inventions/candle)**, seals, and salves.
- **Pollination**: Increases yield of nearby crops and wild plants.
- **Trade**: Honey and wax store well and travel easily.
- **Pest control**: Uses **[Traps](/en/inventions/traps)** to reduce rodents and hive predators.

## Operating principle

- **Nectar conversion**: Bees turn nectar into honey and store it in wax cells.
- **Hive shelter**: A dry, protected cavity reduces weather stress and predators.
- **Smoke control**: Cool smoke from a small **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** masks alarm cues and calms the colony.
- **Space management**: Removing full combs and adding empty space reduces swarming.

## Protection

- **Beekeeper barrier**: Simple veils and wraps from **[Plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** reduce face stings while keeping visibility.
- **Calm handling**: Cool smoke from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)** lowers defensive response and allows slower, safer movements.
- **Hive hardening**: Seal cracks with **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)** and keep hives elevated on **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** supports to limit damp and crawling pests.
- **Perimeter defense**: Place **[Traps](/en/inventions/traps)** near approach paths and keep clear flight lanes in an **[Apiary](/en/inventions/apiary)**.

## How to create it

1. **Choose a site**: Select a spot with sun, wind break, nearby **[Water](/en/materials/water)**, and abundant flowers. For multiple hives, plan an **[Apiary](/en/inventions/apiary)**.
2. **Build a hive**: Use a hollow log or box of **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** with a small entrance.
3. **Attract bees**: Rub the inside with **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** or place old comb as bait.
4. **Stabilize the colony**: Keep the hive dry, ventilated, and level.
5. **Manage the comb**: Inspect occasionally, remove damaged comb, and add space when full.
6. **Harvest**: Take capped honeycomb, leaving enough stores for the colony.
7. **Render wax**: Melt and strain comb for reusable wax.

### Required technological level

Basic to intermediate. Simple log hives are low tech; box hives and regular inspection require more skill.

## Materials needed

- **Essential**: **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** for the hive, **[Beeswax](/en/materials/beeswax)** as comb starter, water nearby.
- **Tools**: Knife, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for honey, smoke source from **[Fire](/en/inventions/fire)**.
- **Substitutes**: Woven baskets sealed with **[Resin](/en/materials/resin)**, clay pot hives with small entrances.

## Variants and improvements

- **Log hives**: Simple hollowed trunks, minimal maintenance.
- **Top-bar hives**: Removable bars for cleaner harvest.
- **Box hives**: Stackable sections for expansion and easier inspection.
- **Migratory keeping**: Moving hives to follow seasonal blooms.

## Limits and risks

- **Stings and allergies**: Protective clothing and distance reduce risk.
- **Disease and pests**: Mites, mold, or starvation can collapse colonies.
- **Robbing**: Strong colonies may steal honey from weak ones.
- **Overharvest**: Taking too much honey weakens the hive.
- **Heat stress**: Poor ventilation can melt combs or kill brood.
