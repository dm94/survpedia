# Balancing

Balancing is the process of adjusting the mass distribution of a tool or weapon to optimize its handling, efficiency, and ergonomics. In the context of **[Forging](/en/knowledge/forging)**, it is a critical step in the design and finishing of an object.

## Importance

A well-balanced object feels lighter than it actually is and allows for more precise control.

- **Tools (Hammers, Axes)**: The center of mass should be concentrated in the head to maximize the force of the blow.
- **Weapons (Swords)**: The point of balance (POB) determines the weapon's character.
  - **Near the Hilt**: Makes the weapon faster and more agile (good for thrusting or defensive fencing).
  - **Near the Tip**: Increases impact force (good for chopping or cutting).

## Principles

### Center of Mass

The point where the object would balance perfectly if suspended.

### Center of Percussion (Sweet Spot)

The point on a striking implement (like a sword or bat) where an impact produces the least shock to the user's hand.

### Pivot Points

Points around which the weapon rotates naturally when manipulated. Understanding these helps in designing weapons that flow with the user's movements.

## Techniques in Forging

Balancing is achieved through careful shaping and material distribution during the forging process.

1.  **Distal Taper**: Thinning the blade or tool from the base (near the handle) towards the tip. This reduces weight at the end, bringing the balance point closer to the hand.
2.  **Profile Taper**: Narrowing the width of the blade towards the tip.
3.  **Fullering**: Creating a groove (fuller) along the blade to remove material and weight without significantly sacrificing stiffness (similar to an I-beam).
4.  **Pommel**: Adding a heavy counterweight at the end of the handle (pommel) to pull the balance point back.
5.  **Tang Construction**: The width and thickness of the tang (the part inside the handle) affect the overall weight distribution.

## Relation to Other Processes

- **[Forging](/en/knowledge/forging)**: The primary method for creating the initial mass distribution.
- **[Grinding/Shaping](/en/knowledge/shaping)**: Used for fine-tuning the balance by removing small amounts of material.
