# Brief description

Wheel construction, or wheelwrighting, is the craft of building and repairing wooden wheels. While a solid wheel is simple to make, the spoked wheel is a complex engineering feat that requires precise joinery, understanding of wood properties, and metalworking skills to create a lightweight yet strong structure capable of bearing heavy loads over rough terrain.

## Use / Function

- **Manufacturing:** Producing wheels for [carts](/en/inventions/cart), [wagons](/en/inventions/wagon), and [chariots](/en/inventions/chariot).
- **Repair:** Maintaining wheels that have been damaged by wear or impact.
- **Optimization:** Creating wheels specific to the load and terrain (e.g., wide rims for mud, large diameter for speed).

## Operating principle

A spoked wheel acts as a suspension system in tension and compression.

- **Compression:** The weight of the vehicle travels down the spokes from the hub to the ground.
- **Tension:** The metal tire, when shrunk onto the rim, compresses all wooden components together, holding them tight without glue.
- **Dishing:** Spoked wheels are often "dished" (cone-shaped) to resist lateral forces when the vehicle sways.

## How to create it

### The Spoked Wheel Process

1.  **The Hub (Nave):**
    - Turn a block of seasoned elm (resistant to splitting) on a [lathe](/en/inventions/manual-lathe).
    - Mortise holes for the spokes. These must be staggered to prevent the hub from cracking.
2.  **The Spokes:**
    - Shape straight-grained oak into spokes.
    - Drive them into the hub with a heavy hammer. They must fit perfectly to avoid wobbling.
3.  **The Rim (Felloes):**
    - Cut curved sections (felloes) from ash or bend straight wood using steam.
    - Drill holes in the felloes to accept the ends of the spokes (tangs).
    - Fit the felloes onto the spokes to form a complete circle.
4.  **The Tire (Straking/Hooping):**
    - **Strakes:** Nail separate curved iron plates across the joints of the felloes (older method).
    - **Hoop:** Forge a continuous iron ring slightly smaller than the wooden wheel.
    - Heat the iron tire to expand it.
    - Place the hot tire over the wooden wheel and immediately quench it with water.
    - The cooling iron shrinks, pulling the felloes, spokes, and hub tightly together.

## Materials needed

- **Hub:** Elm (doesn't split easily).
- **Spokes:** Oak (strong in compression).
- **Rim:** Ash (flexible and resilient).
- **Tire:** [Iron](/en/materials/iron) (durable).
- **Tools:** [Lathe](/en/inventions/manual-lathe), spoke shave, adze, traveler (for measuring circumference), forge.

## Variants and improvements

- **Solid Wheel:** Three planks pegged together and cut into a circle. Heavy and prone to breaking across the grain.
- **Dished Wheel:** Spokes are angled outwards to provide lateral stability.
- **Suspension Wheel:** (Modern bicycle wheel) Spokes are wire and under tension, hanging the hub from the top of the rim.

## Limits and risks

- **Wood Movement:** Wood expands and contracts with humidity. A wheel built in damp conditions may become loose in dry weather.
- **Tire Failure:** If the tire stretches or breaks, the entire wheel can disintegrate.
- **Rot:** Constant exposure to mud and water can rot the wood, especially at the joints.
