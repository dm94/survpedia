Blood type is a biological classification of blood based on specific antigens on red blood cells. It determines which blood is compatible for transfusions and how the immune system reacts to foreign blood.

## Description of what it is like

Blood type is not a visible feature. It is defined by which surface antigens are present on red blood cells, most commonly ABO (A, B, AB, O) and Rh (positive or negative).

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: In the bloodstream of humans and many animals.
- **Signs**: Identified only through blood typing tests or genetic records.
- **Natural**: Set by inheritance and remains stable for life.

### Minimum processing required

- **Sample**: Obtain a small blood sample with clean tools.
- **Reagents**: Mix with anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D (Rh) antibodies.
- **Observation**: Look for clumping (agglutination) to identify the type.
- **Record**: Label and document immediately to avoid mix-ups.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Clean needle or lancet**: For a small blood draw.
- **Slides or card**: For agglutination testing.
- **Saline**: For dilutions and rinsing.
- **Labels and records**: To prevent identification errors.
- **Cool storage**: Short-term preservation of samples.

### Common forms of use

- **ABO/Rh typing**: The standard compatibility check.
- **Crossmatching**: Additional testing before transfusion.
- **Emergency identification**: Wrist tags or records for rapid care.
- **Pregnancy care**: Rh monitoring to prevent sensitization.

### Possible substitutes

- **Direct crossmatch**: When full typing reagents are not available.
- **History-based compatibility**: Only as a temporary stopgap with high risk.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Mislabeling**: The most dangerous error in field settings.
- **Weak reactions**: Poor reagents or low cell counts can give false results.
- **Contamination**: Dirty tools or old samples distort testing.
- **Incomplete typing**: Rare subtypes and other antigen systems can still react.

### Risks and safety

- **Biohazard**: Blood can carry pathogens.
- **Needle injury**: Risk of infection from accidental sticks.
- **Immune reaction**: Incompatible transfusions can be fatal.
