# Brief description

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil by delivering water, oxygen, and dissolved nutrients directly to the roots. It enables crop production where soils are poor, contaminated, or scarce.

## Use / Function

- **Food production:** Grow vegetables and herbs in controlled conditions.
- **Water efficiency:** Reuse and recirculate water with minimal losses.
- **Space efficiency:** Produce in small areas, indoors, or on rooftops.
- **Soil independence:** Avoid soil-borne pests, weeds, and salinity.

## Operating principle

Plants need **water**, **oxygen**, **light**, and **nutrients**. Hydroponics replaces soil with an inert medium or bare roots while a nutrient solution provides minerals. Oxygen reaches roots through air gaps, flowing water, or porous media.

## How to create it

1. **Choose a simple system:** A wick system or static reservoir (Kratky) requires no electricity.
2. **Build a reservoir:** Use a sealed **[container](/en/inventions/containers)** to hold nutrient water.
3. **Support the plant:** Fill a net cup or perforated pot with **[gravel](/en/materials/gravel)**, **[sand](/en/materials/sand)**, or **[clay](/en/materials/clay)** and place the seedling.
4. **Deliver nutrients:** Mix clean **[water](/en/materials/water)** with dissolved nutrients and keep the roots partially submerged.
5. **Provide oxygen:** Leave an air gap, stir daily, or circulate water using a **[pump](/en/inventions/pump)**.
6. **Manage light and heat:** Provide consistent light and protect the system from overheating and algae.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Clean **[water](/en/materials/water)**, containers, inert media (**[gravel](/en/materials/gravel)**, **[sand](/en/materials/sand)**, or **[clay](/en/materials/clay)**), and seeds.
- **Structure:** **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** frames or **[glass](/en/materials/glass)** covers for protection and humidity control.
- **Filtration:** **[charcoal](/en/materials/charcoal)** to reduce odors and organic buildup when water is reused.
- **Possible substitutes:** Fiber wicks made from **[plant fibers](/en/materials/plant-fibers)** and gravity-fed flow from elevated reservoirs.

## Variants and improvements

- **Wick system:** Capillary action feeds roots from below with no moving parts.
- **Kratky method:** Static nutrient solution with a growing air gap.
- **Deep water culture:** Roots sit in aerated water for fast growth.
- **Nutrient film technique (NFT):** Thin flowing layer of nutrient water over roots.
- **Ebb and flow:** Periodic flooding and draining to oxygenate roots.

## Limits and risks

- **Nutrient imbalance:** Incorrect mix leads to stunted growth or leaf burn.
- **Root oxygen loss:** Stagnant water can cause rot and disease.
- **Algae growth:** Light-exposed water encourages algae and clogs.
- **Temperature swings:** Warm water lowers oxygen and increases pathogens.
- **Dependency:** If circulation stops, sensitive crops decline quickly.
