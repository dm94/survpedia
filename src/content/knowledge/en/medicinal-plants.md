Medicinal plants are various species of vegetation that possess bioactive compounds used for therapeutic purposes. They are the foundation of traditional medicine and the precursor to modern pharmacology.

## Description of what it is like

They vary widely in appearance depending on the species (herbs, shrubs, trees, roots). Common characteristics often include distinct aromas, bitter tastes, or specific textures. Parts used can be leaves, flowers, roots, bark, or seeds.

## Origin and where to find it

- **Environments**: Forests, meadows, riverbanks, arid regions. Almost every ecosystem has medicinal flora.
- **Signs**: Specific leaf shapes, flowers, or scents (e.g., minty smell, chamomile flowers).
- **Natural**: They grow wild but can be cultivated for consistent supply.

### Minimum processing required

- **Harvesting**: Collecting the specific part of the plant at the right time (e.g., flowers in bloom, roots in autumn).
- **Drying**: Removing moisture to prevent mold and store them for long periods.
- **Garbling**: Separating the useful parts from dirt and stems.

### Tools needed to work on it

- **Knife/Sickle**: For harvesting.
- **Basket**: For collection.
- **Drying Rack**: For preservation.
- **[Mortar](/en/inventions/mortar)**: For crushing and grinding.

### Common forms of use

- **Fresh**: Applied directly to wounds (poultice) or chewed.
- **Dried**: Used for teas (infusions) or stored for later processing.
- **Powdered**: Ground dried plants for easy dosing or mixing.

### Possible substitutes

- **Other plants**: Many plants have overlapping effects (e.g., willow bark and meadowsweet both contain salicylates for pain).
- **Synthetic drugs**: Modern pharmaceutical equivalents.

### Limitations and common failures

- **Seasonality**: Many plants are only available at certain times of the year.
- **Potency variability**: The strength of the medicine varies based on soil, weather, and harvest time.
- **Identification errors**: Confusing a medicinal plant with a toxic lookalike.

### Risks and safety

- **Toxicity**: Many medicinal plants are toxic in high doses or if prepared incorrectly.
- **Allergies**: Reactions to specific plant families.
- **Interactions**: Can interact with other medicines.
