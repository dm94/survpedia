# Brief description

Vision problems, specifically refractive errors, are common conditions where the eye cannot focus light correctly on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. Addressing these issues is crucial for survival, as clear sight is essential for hunting, gathering, and identifying dangers.

## Use / Function

- **Diagnosis:** Identifying the specific type of vision loss to determine the correct remedy.
- **Safety:** Preventing accidents caused by poor depth perception or inability to spot threats.
- **Productivity:** Enabling precision work (crafting, reading, medical procedures) that requires sharp focus.
- **Quality of Life:** Reducing eye strain and headaches associated with uncorrected vision.

## Operating principle

The eye works like a camera. Light enters through the **cornea** (clear front window), passes through the **pupil**, and is focused by the **lens** onto the **retina** (light-sensitive tissue at the back).

- **Normal Vision:** Light focuses precisely on the retina.
- **Refractive Error:** The shape of the eye prevents light from focusing directly on the retina.
- **Accommodation:** The eye's natural lens changes shape to focus on near or far objects. This ability diminishes with age (Presbyopia).

## How to diagnose

1.  **Visual Acuity Test (Snellen Chart):** A chart with rows of letters that get smaller from top to bottom.
    - Stand 20 feet (6 meters) away.
    - Read the rows with one eye covered, then the other.
    - Difficulty reading the top lines indicates poor distance vision (Myopia).
2.  **Near Vision Test:** Hold a text or small object 14-16 inches (35-40 cm) away.
    - Difficulty focusing indicates Hyperopia or Presbyopia.
3.  **Pinhole Test:** Look through a tiny hole (pinhole) in a card.
    - If vision improves significantly, the problem is likely a refractive error (fixable with glasses).
    - If vision does not improve, it may be a disease (cataract, retinal damage) which glasses cannot fix.

### Required technological level

Basic to Intermediate. Diagnosis requires simple tools (charts, pinholes), but understanding the optics requires some knowledge of physics and anatomy.

## Variants / Types

- **Myopia (Nearsightedness):**
  - **Symptoms:** Distant objects are blurry; close objects are clear.
  - **Cause:** The eye is too long or the cornea is too curved. Light focuses _in front_ of the retina.
  - **Correction:** **[Concave Lens](/en/inventions/lens)** (diverging).
- **Hyperopia (Farsightedness):**
  - **Symptoms:** Close objects are blurry; distant objects may be clear (or also blurry in severe cases).
  - **Cause:** The eye is too short or the cornea is too flat. Light focuses _behind_ the retina.
  - **Correction:** **[Convex Lens](/en/inventions/lens)** (converging).
- **Presbyopia (Aging Eyes):**
  - **Symptoms:** Difficulty focusing on close objects, usually starting around age 40.
  - **Cause:** The natural lens hardens and loses flexibility.
  - **Correction:** **[Reading Glasses](/en/inventions/eyeglasses)** (Convex lens).
- **Astigmatism:**
  - **Symptoms:** Distorted or blurred vision at all distances.
  - **Cause:** Irregularly shaped cornea (like a football instead of a basketball).
  - **Correction:** Cylindrical lens (complex to manufacture).

## Limits and risks

- **Progressive Nature:** Vision often changes over time; a single pair of glasses may not last forever.
- **Disease vs. Refraction:** Glasses cannot fix blindness caused by cataracts, glaucoma, or infection.
- **Headaches:** Uncorrected vision problems often lead to chronic headaches and fatigue.
- **Night Blindness:** Poor vision in low light, often due to Vitamin A deficiency, not refractive error.
