# Brief Description

Natural refrigeration encompasses a set of techniques and physical principles used to reduce the temperature of spaces, food, or liquids without the use of electricity or modern mechanical compressors. It relies on harnessing natural phenomena such as evaporation, nocturnal thermal radiation, earth's thermal inertia, and convective ventilation.

## Use / Function

Its goal is to preserve food, cool water, and provide thermal comfort in dwellings.

- **Primary Use**: Preservation of perishable foods (meat, milk, vegetables) and cooling of living spaces.
- **Secondary Use**: Ice production (under certain conditions) and passive climate control.
- **Scale**: From small domestic devices (Zeer pot) to large architectural structures (Ice houses, Windcatchers).

## Operating Principle

It relies on several key thermodynamic principles:

1.  **Evaporative Cooling**: Water absorbs heat from the environment as it evaporates (phase change from liquid to gas). Example: *Zeer pot*.
2.  **Thermal Mass and Inertia**: Dense materials (earth, stone) are slow to change temperature, maintaining the coolness accumulated during the night or winter. Example: *Cellars, caves*.
3.  **Nocturnal Radiative Cooling**: Surfaces radiate heat towards the clear night sky, cooling down below ambient temperature. Example: *Desert ice making (Yakhchal)*.
4.  **Natural Convection**: Hot air rises and cold air sinks, allowing the creation of airflows that expel heat. Example: *Windcatcher, solar chimney*.
5.  **Thermal Insulation**: Use of materials that resist heat flow to maintain internal coolness. Example: *Ice house with straw*.

## How to Create It

It is not a single object, but an application of techniques. General methods are described here:

### Underground Storage (Root Cellars)
1.  Dig a deep hole (underground temperature is constant and cool, approx. 10-15°C / 50-60°F a few meters down).
2.  Reinforce walls with stone or brick.
3.  Ensure adequate ventilation and drainage.

### Simple Evaporative Cooling
1.  Place porous water containers (clay jugs) in drafts.
2.  Cover food with damp cloths in a ventilated place.

### Ice Harvesting and Storage (Ice House)
1.  Harvest ice or snow in winter.
2.  Store it in a deep pit insulated with thick layers of straw and wood.
3.  Ice can last until the following summer if insulation is good.

## Materials Needed

- **Water**: The most common coolant (for evaporation).
- **Insulators**: Straw, sawdust, cork, charcoal (to protect ice or cold).
- **Thermal Mass**: Stone, earth, adobe, brick (for structures).
- **Porous Containers**: Unglazed clay (for evaporation).

## Variants and Improvements

- **Zeer Pot**: Two pots with wet sand between them.
- **Yakhchal**: Ancient Persian structure for storing ice and cooling via evaporation and radiation.
- **Charcoal Cooler**: Double-walled box filled with charcoal kept wet; passing air cools the interior.
- **Spring House**: Small building over a natural spring to use the cold running water as a coolant.

## Limits and Risks

- **Humidity**: Evaporative cooling does not work well in very humid climates (jungles).
- **Temperature Limits**: It hardly drops below freezing (0°C / 32°F) (except with stored ice), so it is not suitable for long-term deep freezing.
- **Bacteria**: Moisture and cool but not freezing temperatures can encourage certain molds if hygiene is not maintained.
