# Brief description

Written language is a system of graphic representation of a language by means of signs engraved, drawn, or printed on a support. It allows for the detachment of communication from the immediate presence of the speaker, making it the basis of history, science, and complex administration.

## Use / Function

Its practical purpose is to preserve and transmit information across time and space:

- **Record-keeping:** Accounting, laws, censuses, and historical chronicles.
- **Communication:** Sending messages over long distances without relying on memory.
- **Preservation of knowledge:** Storing scientific, religious, and cultural information for future generations.
- **Legal and Personal Identity:** Signatures, seals, and contracts.

## Operating principle

It is based on assigning specific meanings to arbitrary visual symbols. These symbols can be:

1. **Logographic:** Representing words or morphemes (e.g., Chinese characters).
2. **Syllabic:** Representing syllables (e.g., Japanese Hiragana).
3. **Alphabetic:** Representing individual sounds or phonemes (e.g., Latin, Greek, Cyrillic).

The process involves encoding spoken language into these symbols on a durable medium, which can then be decoded (read) by anyone who knows the code.

## How to create it

- **Step 1: Code Definition:** Establish or learn a system of signs that corresponds to the language.
- **Step 2: Surface Preparation:** Prepare a flat and durable support (like a clay tablet, a sheet of papyrus, or paper).
- **Step 3: Marking:** Use a tool (stylus, brush, pen) and a marking substance (ink) or physical deformation (engraving) to record the signs.
- **Step 4: Fixation:** Allow the ink to dry or the clay to harden to ensure the message lasts.

## Materials needed

- **Supports:**
  - **Clay:** For cuneiform (must be wet during writing and fired/dried later).
  - **Papyrus:** Made from plant fibers, common in ancient Egypt.
  - **Parchment:** Made from animal skins, highly durable.
  - **Paper:** Made from processed cellulose pulp.
- **Marking Substances:**
  - **Ink:** Pigments (like charcoal) mixed with binders and solvents.
  - **Charcoal/Graphite:** For dry drawing or writing.
- **Tools:**
  - **Stylus:** For engraving on clay or wax.
  - **Reed Pen/Quill:** For applying liquid ink.
  - **Brush:** For calligraphic writing.

## Variants and improvements

- **Cuneiform:** One of the earliest forms, using wedge-shaped marks on clay.
- **Hieroglyphs:** Using pictorial symbols.
- **The Alphabet:** A major improvement in efficiency, reducing the number of signs needed to be learned.
- **Printing Press:** Mechanized the production of written language, allowing for mass distribution.
- **Digital Text:** Encoding signs into binary data for electronic storage and display.

## Limits and risks

- **Fragility of supports:** Fire, humidity, and insects can destroy paper, papyrus, and parchment.
- **Loss of the code:** If the knowledge of how to read a script is lost, the information becomes inaccessible (e.g., undeciphered ancient scripts).
- **Ambiguity:** Written language lacks the tone and body language of speech, which can lead to misinterpretation.
- **Exclusion:** Historically, literacy was a tool of power restricted to elite classes.
