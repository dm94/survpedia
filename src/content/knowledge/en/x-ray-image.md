# Brief description

An X-ray image is a shadow map of how much different materials absorb X-rays. Dense materials like bone or metal block more radiation and appear lighter, while soft tissue lets more through and appears darker.

## Use / Function

- **Medical diagnosis:** Bones, lungs, teeth, and foreign objects.
- **Non-destructive inspection:** Cracks and voids in metal parts or welds.
- **Security screening:** Hidden items in luggage or containers.
- **Alignment and quality control:** Internal fit checks without disassembly.
- **Scale:** Clinical, industrial, and field use.

## Operating principle

- **X-ray source:** A **[X-ray tube](/en/inventions/x-ray-tube)** emits high-energy photons.
- **Attenuation:** Materials absorb X-rays based on density and thickness.
- **Detection:** A detector or film converts the remaining beam into an image.
- **Contrast control:** Collimation and shielding reduce scatter.
- **Exposure control:** Time and intensity balance detail and dose.

## How to create it

1. **Prepare the source:** Use a stable **[X-ray apparatus](/en/inventions/x-ray-apparatus)** with shielding.
2. **Collimate the beam:** Narrow it to the area of interest.
3. **Position the object:** Place it between source and detector.
4. **Capture the image:** Record with film or a digital detector.
5. **Review and adjust:** Repeat with corrected exposure if needed.

### Required technological level

Advanced. High voltage, vacuum components, and radiation safety procedures are required.

## Materials needed

- **Essential materials:** **[Glass](/en/materials/glass)**, **[Tungsten](/en/materials/tungsten)**, **[Copper](/en/materials/copper)** for conductors, **[Lead](/en/materials/lead)** for shielding, **[Steel](/en/materials/steel)** for structure.
- **Core equipment:** **[X-ray apparatus](/en/inventions/x-ray-apparatus)**, **[X-ray tube](/en/inventions/x-ray-tube)**, **[Vacuum Tube](/en/inventions/vacuum-tube)** components.
- **Thermal control:** **[X-ray cooling system](/en/inventions/x-ray-cooling-system)** for high duty cycles.

## Variants and improvements

- **Film radiography:** Simple and portable but slower to process.
- **Digital detectors:** Faster capture with lower dose and easier storage.
- **Microfocus imaging:** High detail for small parts.
- **Rotating anode systems:** Higher power and shorter exposure times.

## Limits and risks

- **Radiation exposure:** Requires strict shielding, distance, and time limits.
- **Soft tissue contrast:** Limited without advanced techniques.
- **Motion blur:** Movement reduces sharpness.
- **Scatter artifacts:** Poor collimation degrades image quality.
