# Brief description

Livestock is the managed raising of domesticated animals for food, materials, labor, and trade. It combines controlled grazing, shelter, and breeding to keep herds productive and resilient.

## Use / Function

- **Food supply:** Meat, milk, and eggs when available.
- **Materials:** **[Leather](/en/materials/leather)**, **[Wool](/en/materials/wool)**, **[Bone](/en/materials/bone)**, and **[Animal Fat](/en/materials/animal-fat)**.
- **Labor:** Draft power for transport and field work.
- **Fertility:** Manure for soil enrichment and composting.
- **Storage:** Animals are living food reserves for lean seasons.

## Operating principle

- **Forage conversion:** Animals turn grasses and crop residues into protein and fats.
- **Water and shelter:** Regular access to water and protection from weather prevent loss.
- **Controlled breeding:** Selecting healthy animals improves yield and temperament.
- **Health management:** Clean bedding, rotation, and observation reduce disease.

## How to create it

1. **Choose species:** Match animals to climate, terrain, and local forage.
2. **Secure water and feed:** Reliable water, grazing areas, and stored fodder.
3. **Build containment:** Fences, pens, or corrals using **[Wood](/en/materials/wood)** and **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)**.
4. **Set routines:** Rotate grazing, clean bedding, and provide shade.
5. **Manage breeding:** Track seasons, isolate aggressive or sick animals.
6. **Process outputs:** Milking, shearing, and butchering with clean tools and **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for storage.
7. **Handle manure:** Collect and compost to avoid contamination.

## Materials needed

- **Essential:** Water, forage grasses, **[Straw](/en/materials/straw)** for bedding, **[Salt](/en/materials/salt)** for mineral licks.
- **Tools:** **[Rope](/en/inventions/rope)** for tethering, **[Shovel](/en/inventions/shovel)** for cleaning, **[Containers](/en/inventions/containers)** for milk or feed.
- **Substitutes:** Living hedges, stone walls, or woven hurdles for enclosure.

## Variants and improvements

- **Pastoralism:** Mobile herds that follow seasonal forage.
- **Mixed crop-livestock:** Animals feed on residues and fertilize fields.
- **Rotational grazing:** Rested pastures recover and reduce parasites.
- **Dairy focus:** Select for milk yield and gentler temperament.
- **Fiber focus:** Breeds optimized for fleece quality.

## Limits and risks

- **Disease:** Zoonoses and parasites spread quickly in dense herds.
- **Overgrazing:** Soil compaction and erosion reduce long-term yield.
- **Predators and theft:** Require strong containment and vigilance.
- **Feed gaps:** Drought or winter can cause rapid losses without stored fodder.
- **Waste hazards:** Manure can pollute water if unmanaged.
